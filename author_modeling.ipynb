    "# Author Modeling Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a 5-stage pipeline for modeling an author's characteristic writing patterns through few-shot example curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than extracting explicit style rules, this approach models the author's **decision-making patterns** and **sensibility**, then curates exemplary passages for tacit transmission via few-shot learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage 1: Analytical Mining** - Analyze sample texts through three lenses:\n",
    "   - Implied Author: Sensibility and stance\n",
    "   - Decision Patterns: Compositional choices\n",
    "   - Functional Texture: How surface features serve purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stage 2: Cross-Text Synthesis** - Synthesize each dimension across multiple samples to identify stable patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stage 3: Field Guide Construction** - Integrate all three syntheses into unified recognition criteria and density rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stage 4: Passage Evaluation** - Evaluate passages from corpus using field guide (1-5 density rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stage 5: Example Set Construction** - Curate 3-4 high-density passages that balance density, diversity, and complementarity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline is author-agnostic. The Russell corpus is used as a test case, but the same approach applies to any author."

      "formerly confined to a few. This aspect of the movement is as easy to\n",
      "grasp at a distance as it is in Russia--perhaps even easier, because\n",
      "in Russia present circumstances tend to obscure the view of the\n",
      "distant future. But the actual situation in Russia can only be\n",

      "fanaticism is a camouflage for cruelty. Fanatics are seldom genuinely\n",

      "#### 1. RELATIONSHIP TO MATERIAL\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation**: The author writes with a blend of curiosity and mastery, often seeking to unravel complexities and share insights. They approach the material with a keen intellectual interest, breaking down complex ideas into digestible parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence**:\n",
      "1. \"The bent stick in water belongs here. People say it looks bent but is straight: this only means that it is straight to the touch, though bent to sight. There is no 'illusion,' but only a false inference, if we think that the stick would feel bent to the touch.\"\n",
      "2. \"It is a mistake to ask whether the 'thing' is duplicated when we see it double. The 'thing' is a whole system of 'sensibilia,' and it is only those visual 'sensibilia' which are data to the percipient that are duplicated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation**: These passages show the author's willingness to engage with complex phenomena and explain them in a way that clarifies misunderstandings. The use of precise language and logical reasoning indicates a mastery of the subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. RELATIONSHIP TO READER\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation**: The author imagines the reader as an intellectual equal, capable of following intricate arguments and logical deductions. There is a sense of intimacy, as if the author is sharing a personal journey of intellectual discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence**:\n",
      "1. \"It is a mistake to ask whether the 'thing' is duplicated when we see it double.\"\n",
      "2. \"Dreams might conceivably belong to this class, if they were jointed sufficiently neatly into waking life; but the chief instances are recurrent sensory hallucinations of the kind that lead to insanity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation**: The author assumes the reader is familiar with concepts like \"sensibilia\" and \"hallucinations,\" indicating a level of intellectual trust. The use of \"we\" and \"our\" creates a sense of shared exploration and understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. RELATIONSHIP TO UNCERTAINTY\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation**: The author handles uncertainty with a balanced approach, acknowledging alternative views while maintaining a confident stance where evidence is strong. They are comfortable with provisional conclusions and the complexity of their subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence**:\n",
      "1. \"It is a mistake to ask whether the 'thing' is duplicated when we see it double.\"\n",
      "2. \"There certainly are cases where (whatever psychological causes may contribute) the presence of physical causes also is very evident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation**: These passages show the author's willingness to acknowledge the limits of knowledge and the possibility of alternative explanations. They qualify their statements without undermining their overall confidence in their arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACT OF WRITING\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation**: The author takes pleasure in the act of writing, often employing wit and wordplay to convey complex ideas. They use language not just as a tool but as an aesthetic medium, enjoying the craft of prose.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Evidence**:\n",
      "1. \"The whole dream will be an appearance of the door banging, but owing to the peculiar condition of the body (especially the brain) during sleep, this appearance is not that expected to be produced by a door banging.\"\n",
      "2. \"The 'thing' is a whole system of 'sensibilia,' and it is only those visual 'sensibilia' which are data to the percipient that are duplicated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation**: The use of vivid imagery and precise, almost playful, language indicates an author who enjoys the process of writing. The prose is not merely instrumental but calls attention to itself through its craftsmanship.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Explanation**: This passage is particularly revealing because it showcases the author's ability to break down a complex concept into understandable parts. It reflects their mastery of the subject matter and their desire to share this understanding with the reader.\n",

      "The first passage uses the metaphor of a \"tragic fatality\" brooding over Russia, adding a poetic dimension to the historical analysis.

The writer takes pleasure in the act of writing, employing vivid metaphors and evocative language to express complex thoughts. There is a balanced approach to uncertainty, qualifying claims where necessary and acknowledging alternatives, but also asserting well-grounded conclusions with confidence. The prose imagines the reader as a fellow traveler, someone who is curious and intellectually engaged, assuming a baseline of familiarity with philosophical concepts but explaining complex ideas to ensure clarity. There is a sense of intimacy, as if engaging in a private, thoughtful conversation. This author values the marriage of scientific temper with mystical insight, handling complexity with a sense of discovery and mastery. The mind behind the writing is one that relishes the exploration of ideas, taking delight in both the substance and the language used to convey them.\n",

    "1. ✅ **Stage 1**: Analyzed samples through three lenses (implied author, decision patterns, functional texture)\n",
    "2. ✅ **Stage 2**: Synthesized each dimension across samples\n",
    "3. ✅ **Stage 3**: Constructed unified field guide with recognition criteria and rubric\n",
    "4. ✅ **Stage 4**: Evaluated passages using field guide (density ratings 1-5)\n",
    "5. ✅ **Stage 5**: Curated 3-4 high-density passages as few-shot example set\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Use exported field guide for understanding author's patterns\n",
    "- Use example set for few-shot learning in generation tasks\n",
    "- Compare few-shot results against baseline methods (Stage 6 - future work)\n",
