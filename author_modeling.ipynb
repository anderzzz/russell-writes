    "# Author Modeling Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a 5-stage pipeline for modeling an author's characteristic writing patterns through few-shot example curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than extracting explicit style rules, this approach models the author's **decision-making patterns** and **sensibility**, then curates exemplary passages for tacit transmission via few-shot learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage 1: Analytical Mining** - Analyze sample texts through three lenses:\n",
    "   - Implied Author: Sensibility and stance\n",
    "   - Decision Patterns: Compositional choices\n",
    "   - Functional Texture: How surface features serve purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stage 2: Cross-Text Synthesis** - Synthesize each dimension across multiple samples to identify stable patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stage 3: Field Guide Construction** - Integrate all three syntheses into unified recognition criteria and density rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stage 4: Passage Evaluation** - Evaluate passages from corpus using field guide (1-5 density rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stage 5: Example Set Construction** - Curate 3-4 high-density passages that balance density, diversity, and complementarity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline is author-agnostic. The Russell corpus is used as a test case, but the same approach applies to any author."

      "\n",
      "### 1. RELATIONSHIP TO MATERIAL\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation:**\n",
      "This author approaches the material with a critical and analytical stance, often challenging the ideas presented and seeking to dissect them rigorously. The text reveals a mind that is both curious and skeptical, eager to probe the depths of philosophical claims to reveal their inconsistencies and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quoted Passages:**\n",
      "1. \"Of Bergson's theory that intellect is a purely practical faculty, developed in the struggle for survival, and not a source of true beliefs, we may say, first, that it is only through intellect that we know of the struggle for survival and of the biological ancestry of man: if the intellect is misleading, the whole of this merely inferred history is presumably untrue.\"\n",
      "2. \"The hen with a brood of ducklings no doubt has intuition which seems to place her inside them, and not merely to know them analytically; but when the ducklings take to the water, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be illusory, and the hen is left helpless on the shore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "These passages show the author's critical engagement with Bergson's theories. The first passage highlights the author's skepticism towards Bergson's claim about the intellect's unreliability, pointing out the logical inconsistencies in Bergson's argument. The second passage uses a metaphor to illustrate the limitations of intuition, demonstrating the author's willingness to challenge and dissect complex ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. RELATIONSHIP TO READER\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation:**\n",
      "The author imagines the reader to be a fellow intellectual, capable of following complex arguments and willing to engage critically with philosophical ideas. The prose assumes a level of familiarity with philosophical concepts and expects the reader to be interested in detailed, logical analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quoted Passages:**\n",
      "1. \"This procedure, since it takes sides in a conflict of instinctive beliefs, stands in need of justification by proving the greater trustworthiness of the beliefs on one side than of those on the other.\"\n",
      "2. \"The theoretical understanding of the world, which is the aim of philosophy, is not a matter of great practical importance to animals, or to savages, or even to most civilised men.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "The first passage assumes the reader is familiar with the idea of conflicting beliefs and the need for justification in philosophical discourse. The second passage implies that the reader understands the distinction between practical importance and theoretical understanding, indicating a level of intellectual sophistication.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. RELATIONSHIP TO UNCERTAINTY\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation:**\n",
      "The author handles uncertainty by acknowledging the provisional nature of some claims while asserting confidence in others based on logical reasoning. The text shows a balanced approach to uncertainty, neither overly confident nor overly cautious.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quoted Passages:**\n",
      "1. \"It is true that intuition has a convincingness which is lacking to intellect: while it is present, it is almost impossible to doubt its truth. But if it should appear, on examination, to be at least as fallible as intellect, its greater subjective certainty becomes a demerit, making it only the more irresistibly deceptive.\"\n",
      "2. \"The logic used in defence of mysticism seems to be faulty as logic, and open to technical criticisms, which I have explained elsewhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "The first passage acknowledges the convincing nature of intuition but qualifies this by pointing out its potential fallibility. The second passage asserts the faultiness of mystical logic but qualifies this by referring to technical criticisms explained elsewhere, showing a willingness to acknowledge the limits of the current discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACT OF WRITING\n",
      "\n",
      "**Observation:**\n",
      "The author appears to take pleasure in the act of writing, employing wit and wordplay to enhance the prose. The text is not merely instrumental but aims to engage the reader through its style and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quoted Passages:**\n",
      "1. \"The savage deceived by false friendship is likely to pay for his mistake with his life; whereas even in the most civilised societies men are not put to death for mathematical incompetence.\"\n",
      "2. \"Only direct acquaintance can give knowledge of what is unique and new. But direct acquaintance of this kind is given fully in sensation, and does not require, so far as I can see, any special faculty of intuition for its apprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "The first passage uses a playful comparison to illustrate a point about the practical value of intuition versus intellect. The second passage employs a rhetorical device to underscore the importance of direct experience, showing the author's enjoyment of the writing process.\n",
      "\n",
      "## PART 2: SIGNATURE MOMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quoted Passage 1:\n",
      "\"The hen with a brood of ducklings no doubt has intuition which seems to place her inside them, and not merely to know them analytically; but when the ducklings take to the water, the whole apparent intuition is seen to be illusory, and the hen is left helpless on the shore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "This passage is particularly recognizable for its use of a vivid metaphor to illustrate a philosophical point. It combines the author's critical stance, engagement with complexity, and enjoyment of wordplay, making it a signature moment.\n",

      "The implied author of this text is a rigorous and critical thinker, deeply engaged with the complexities of philosophical discourse. This mind is characterized by a blend of curiosity and skepticism, always ready to probe the depths of an argument to reveal its inconsistencies and limitations. The author assumes a reader who is intellectually sophisticated, capable of following intricate reasoning and appreciative of wit and wordplay. There is a clear enjoyment in the act of writing, with the prose often employing vivid metaphors and playful comparisons to enhance its points. This author is comfortable with uncertainty, acknowledging the provisional nature of some claims while asserting confidence in others based on logical reasoning. Overall, the implied author is a keen analyst, a thoughtful critic, and a skilled communicator, inviting the reader to join in a rigorous and engaging exploration of ideas.\n"
