    "# Style Instruction Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how well derived style instructions enable style replication, compared to alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text:\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different methods (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Generic baseline\n",
    "   - Few-shot learning\n",
    "   - Author name prompting\n",
    "   - Derived style instructions\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions from 1-4 based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D) - no method names\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 2 = second, 3 = third, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples to eliminate bias\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which method best captures style\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "- There is a school of psychology known as \"behaviourists,\" with Professor John B. Watson (formerly of Johns Hopkins University) as a central figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- John Dewey is also associated with this school, broadly speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Dewey, along with William James and F.C.S. Schiller, was one of the three founders of pragmatism.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The core claim of the behaviourists is that knowledge can only be obtained through external observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- They deny the existence of introspection as a valid source of knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "- They argue that introspection does not provide access to knowledge about oneself that cannot also be observed in others.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The behaviourists do not deny that internal mental events may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, they assert that such internal events are not accessible to scientific observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Therefore, such internal events are not relevant to psychology as a science.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Psychology, according to the behaviourists, should concern itself exclusively with behaviour—defined as what people do.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Behaviour is the only aspect of psychological phenomena that can be accurately observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The possibility of thought occurring during behaviour cannot be known through observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In studying human behaviour, behaviourists report that they have not found observable evidence of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "- While people engage in speech and believe this demonstrates thinking, the behaviourists argue that speech can be explained without assuming thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In behaviourist literature, discussion of \"thought processes\" is replaced with discussion of \"The Language Habit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- This replacement—focusing on language as a habit rather than as evidence of thought—is found to be highly effective in explaining human verbal behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A reference is provided to Watson’s 1914 work, *Behavior: an Introduction to Comparative Psychology*, as a key source.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Behaviourism did not originate from observations of human foolishness.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Instead, it was inspired by the study of animal behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The question of whether animals \"think\" has long been a topic of popular debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "- People often take positions on animal thinking without defining what they mean by \"thinking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- Researchers interested in animal minds began observing animal behaviour to infer mental capacities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Initially, it may appear that such inferences are possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For example, a dog is said to \"know\" its name because it comes when called.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A dog is said to \"remember\" its master based on its emotional reactions—sadness in absence, tail-wagging and barking upon return.\n",
      "\n",
      "- These behavioural responses are observable facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, claims that the dog \"knows\" or \"remembers\" are inferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "- These inferences are questionable and become increasingly dubious upon examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "- As a result, the study of animal behaviour has moved away from mental interpretations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In many cases of complex animal behaviour that is well-adapted to outcomes, there is no evidence that the animal foresees those outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- For example, a bird building a nest for the first time likely does not anticipate that eggs will be laid, that it will sit on them, or that they will hatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The bird acts due to instinctive impulses, not because it desires or foresees the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A reference is provided to Lloyd Morgan’s 1912 work, *Instinct and Experience*, chapter ii, which discusses whether instinctive actions involve prevision.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Careful animal observers, aiming to avoid unjustified inferences, have increasingly described animal actions without assuming consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Behaviourists propose that similar methods should be applied to human behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "- They advocate explaining human actions using only what is externally observable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A simplified illustration is provided to explain the behaviourist approach (noted as too crude for the actual authors but useful for understanding).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Two children are asked, “What is six times nine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "- One answers “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first is said to “know” the answer; the second does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, the only observable difference is the presence or absence of a specific language habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The first child has learned to produce the verbal response “six times nine is fifty-four.”\n",
      "\n",
      "- The second has not acquired this habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The production of the correct answer is comparable to a horse turning into its usual stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both are instances of learned habits, not necessarily involving thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Human knowledge, as tested, is an observable fact—e.g., demonstrated in examinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Examinations function as experiments to detect such facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- However, what is actually observed or detected is a set of verbal or behavioural habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The examiner does not observe the thoughts (if any) of the person being examined.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The thoughts of the examinee are irrelevant to the examiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The examiner has no basis to assume that even a correct answer reflects actual thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Even the most successful examinee may not have engaged in any thought at all, from the behaviourist perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Structure and Reasoning Notes**\n",
      "\n",
      "- The argument begins by identifying behaviourism and its key proponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It presents the central epistemological claim: only external observation is valid for scientific psychology.\n",
      "\n",
      "- It clarifies that behaviourists do not deny internal events per se, but exclude them from scientific study due to lack of observability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The focus is then shifted to the origin of behaviourism in animal studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The discussion of animal behaviour serves as a foundation for extending the method to humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Examples from animal behaviour (dog, bird) illustrate how mentalistic explanations (e.g., knowing, remembering) are replaced with behavioural accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The limitations of inferring mental states from behaviour are emphasized.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The transition to human behaviour is made through analogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The schoolchild example demonstrates how even seemingly cognitive acts (arithmetic) can be interpreted as habitual responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The example reinforces the claim that observable behaviour—specifically, language habits—suffices for explaining what is traditionally attributed to thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Throughout, the author notes qualifications: behaviourists do not deny the possibility of internal processes, only their scientific relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Contrasts are drawn between common-sense interpretations (e.g., \"the dog remembers\") and behaviourist interpretations (e.g., \"the dog behaves in a certain way\").\n",
      "\n",
      "- Emphasis is placed on the methodological stance: avoiding unverifiable inferences, even when they seem intuitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "- References are provided to support key claims about animal instinct and Watson's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The tone of the original text includes ironic or dismissive remarks (e.g., \"humiliating,\" \"talk they have to listen to\"), but these are excluded as stylistic; only the underlying argument is preserved.\n",
      "There is a psychological school called \"Behaviourists,\" of whom the\n",
      "protagonist is Professor John B. Watson,* formerly of the Johns Hopkins\n",
      "University. To them also, on the whole, belongs Professor John Dewey,\n",
      "who, with James and Dr. Schiller, was one of the three founders of\n",
      "pragmatism. The view of the \"behaviourists\" is that nothing can be known\n",
      "except by external observation. They deny altogether that there is a\n",
      "separate source of knowledge called \"introspection,\" by which we can\n",
      "know things about ourselves which we could never observe in others.\n",
      "They do not by any means deny that all sorts of things MAY go on in\n",
      "our minds: they only say that such things, if they occur, are not\n",
      "susceptible of scientific observation, and do not therefore concern\n",
      "psychology as a science. Psychology as a science, they say, is only\n",
      "concerned with BEHAVIOUR, i.e. with what we DO; this alone, they\n",
      "contend, can be accurately observed. Whether we think meanwhile, they\n",
      "tell us, cannot be known; in their observation of the behaviour of human\n",
      "beings, they have not so far found any evidence of thought. True, we\n",
      "talk a great deal, and imagine that in so doing we are showing that we\n",
      "can think; but behaviourists say that the talk they have to listen to\n",
      "can be explained without supposing that people think. Where you might\n",
      "expect a chapter on \"thought processes\" you come instead upon a chapter\n",
      "on \"The Language Habit.\" It is humiliating to find how terribly adequate\n",
      "this hypothesis turns out to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "* See especially his \"Behavior: an Introduction to\n",
      "     Comparative Psychology,\" New York, 1914.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behaviourism has not, however, sprung from observing the folly of men.\n",
      "It is the wisdom of animals that has suggested the view. It has always\n",
      "been a common topic of popular discussion whether animals \"think.\" On\n",
      "this topic people are prepared to take sides without having the vaguest\n",
      "idea what they mean by \"thinking.\" Those who desired to investigate such\n",
      "questions were led to observe the behaviour of animals, in the hope that\n",
      "their behaviour would throw some light on their mental faculties.\n",
      "At first sight, it might seem that this is so. People say that a\n",
      "dog \"knows\" its name because it comes when it is called, and that it\n",
      "\"remembers\" its master, because it looks sad in his absence, but wags\n",
      "its tail and barks when he returns. That the dog behaves in this way is\n",
      "matter of observation, but that it \"knows\" or \"remembers\" anything is an\n",
      "inference, and in fact a very doubtful one. The more such inferences are\n",
      "examined, the more precarious they are seen to be. Hence the study of\n",
      "animal behaviour has been gradually led to abandon all attempt at mental\n",
      "interpretation. And it can hardly be doubted that, in many cases of\n",
      "complicated behaviour very well adapted to its ends, there can be no\n",
      "prevision of those ends. The first time a bird builds a nest, we can\n",
      "hardly suppose it knows that there will be eggs to be laid in it, or\n",
      "that it will sit on the eggs, or that they will hatch into young birds.\n",
      "It does what it does at each stage because instinct gives it an impulse\n",
      "to do just that, not because it foresees and desires the result of its\n",
      "actions.*\n",
      "\n",
      "* An interesting discussion of the question whether\n",
      "     instinctive actions, when first performed, involve any\n",
      "     prevision, however vague, will be found in Lloyd Morgan's\n",
      "     \"Instinct and Experience\" (Methuen, 1912), chap. ii.\n",
      "\n",
      "Careful observers of animals, being anxious to avoid precarious\n",
      "inferences, have gradually discovered more and more how to give\n",
      "an account of the actions of animals without assuming what we call\n",
      "\"consciousness.\" It has seemed to the behaviourists that similar methods\n",
      "can be applied to human behaviour, without assuming anything not open\n",
      "to external observation. Let us give a crude illustration, too crude for\n",
      "the authors in question, but capable of affording a rough insight into\n",
      "their meaning. Suppose two children in a school, both of whom are asked\n",
      "\"What is six times nine?\" One says fifty-four, the other says fifty-six.\n",
      "The one, we say, \"knows\" what six times nine is, the other does not. But\n",

      "has not. There is no more need of \"thought\" in this than there is when\n",
      "a horse turns into his accustomed stable; there are merely more numerous\n",

      "It is a curious and not altogether encouraging circumstance that the progress of science should so often require the dismantling of what appears, to the untrained mind, self-evident. Among the various intellectual movements of our time, one of the most striking is that school of psychology known as Behaviourism, which, under the vigorous leadership of Professor John B. Watson—formerly of Johns Hopkins University—has undertaken the systematic exclusion of introspection from the domain of scientific inquiry. John Dewey, though less rigid in his formulations, may be said to belong, broadly speaking, to this same general tendency, having, indeed, been one of the three principal architects of Pragmatism, alongside William James and F. C. S. Schiller. But it is Watson who has given the movement its most uncompromising expression, and it is to him, and to the method he represents, that we must turn if we are to understand the radical implications of this doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central contention of the Behaviourists is at once simple and devastating to traditional assumptions: knowledge in psychology is to be obtained solely through external observation. They do not, as is sometimes carelessly supposed, deny that internal mental events may occur; they merely insist that such events, if they exist, are not accessible to scientific observation and are therefore irrelevant to the science of psychology. Introspection, that inward gaze so long regarded as the royal road to self-knowledge, is dismissed as a source of error, illusion, and unverifiable assertion. It is not that the Behaviourists claim to disprove the existence of thought or feeling within the individual; rather, they maintain that whatever may transpire behind the veil of privacy cannot be subjected to the rigours of public verification, and thus cannot constitute legitimate data for a discipline aspiring to scientific status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, psychology, as they conceive it, must concern itself exclusively with behaviour—by which is meant, quite simply, what people do. This alone is observable, measurable, and repeatable. The possibility that thought may accompany action is, from their standpoint, a speculation; and a speculation it remains, since no observer can ever detect thought as such. When we study human beings, we observe their movements, their utterances, their reactions to stimuli. We do not observe their cogitations. And if, in the course of such study, no observable evidence of thought presents itself, then the hypothesis of thought, however seductive, becomes superfluous. Language, for instance—so often taken as the very emblem of rationality—is, in the Behaviourist’s lexicon, not an expression of thought, but a habit, a complex motor response acquired through repetition and conditioning. The phrase “thought processes” is accordingly banished from their literature and replaced by the more neutral and less speculative “The Language Habit.” And it must be admitted that this substitution proves remarkably effective in accounting for verbal behaviour, without the need to invoke any invisible and unobservable inner drama.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might be tempted to suppose that such a doctrine arose from a cynical reflection upon human folly, from the observation of how often men speak without thinking, or even believe they are thinking when in fact they are merely repeating phrases. But this, it appears, was not the origin of Behaviourism. Its roots lie rather in the study of animals—a field in which the temptation to anthropomorphize has long been irresistible, and in which, for that very reason, the need for caution is most acute. The question of whether animals “think” has been debated for centuries, usually without any clear agreement as to what “thinking” might mean. Yet, from the time when observers began to study animal behaviour with something approaching scientific care, a certain discipline emerged: the discipline of describing what is seen, and abstaining from what is merely imagined.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that at first glance, animals often seem to exhibit knowledge, memory, even foresight. A dog comes when called: we say he “knows” his name. He is sorrowful in the absence of his master, and joyful at his return: we say he “remembers” him. But these are inferences, not observations. The facts are only that certain stimuli evoke certain responses. The dog behaves in this way or that; whether he experiences anything analogous to what we call memory or recognition is a matter of conjecture. And as observation has sharpened, such conjectures have come to seem increasingly gratuitous. It has been found, for example, that even the most intricate and apparently purposeful sequences of animal behaviour—such as a bird building its nest for the first time—can be satisfactorily explained without supposing that the animal has any foresight of the result. The bird does not build the nest because it desires eggs, or anticipates the warmth of incubation, or foresees the helpless chirping of fledglings. It builds because it is impelled by instinct, by a chain of inherited reactions to environmental cues. As Lloyd Morgan pointed out, in his *Instinct and Experience* (1912), such actions may be perfectly adaptive without involving prevision. The end is achieved, not because it is foreseen, but because the mechanism is well-designed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is from this foundation in animal psychology that the Behaviourist builds his case for the study of man. If we are to avoid the seductions of unwarranted inference in dealing with dogs and birds, why should we indulge them when dealing with children and scholars? Consider, for example, two children asked the question: “What is six times nine?” One says “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.” The first, we say, knows the answer; the second does not. But what, in point of fact, have we observed? Only this: that one child has acquired the habit of uttering a certain string of words in response to a certain stimulus, and the other has not. The difference is behavioural, not mental. The child who says “fifty-four” may have arrived at the answer through thought, or through memory, or through a lucky guess; or he may have none of these things, but simply repeat a formula drilled into him by rote. The examiner cannot tell, and has no need to tell. What is tested in examinations is not thought, but the presence or absence of certain verbal habits. The examiner observes a response, records it, and judges accordingly. He does not peer into the child’s mind; he cannot. And from the standpoint of science, he need not. Even the most brilliant performance may be, for all we can observe, the product of mechanical association rather than of reflection. Indeed, the most successful examinee may not have thought at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the Behaviourist concludes, psychology must restrict itself to what is publicly observable. It must concern itself with stimuli and responses, with habits and modifications of behaviour, with the conditions under which certain actions occur. It must abstain from all discourse about consciousness, about ideas, about will or understanding—unless these terms can be translated into behavioural equivalents. This may seem a bleak and impoverished vision to those who cherish the inner life. But science, like truth, is not always congenial to our preferences. It demands that we renounce the consolations of plausible conjecture and accept the discipline of verifiable fact. Whether this leaves us with a complete account of man, I shall not presume to say. But it does leave us with a method that is at least free from the taint of metaphysical assumption—and in a subject so riddled with illusion as the human mind, that is no small achievement.\n",

      "There is a school of psychology known as the behaviourists, of which Professor John B. Watson, formerly of Johns Hopkins University, may be regarded as the most representative exponent. John Dewey, though differing in many respects, may be broadly classed with this school, particularly in so far as he shares its distrust of introspection as a source of scientific knowledge. Dewey, along with William James and F.C.S. Schiller, was one of the three founders of pragmatism; but the behaviourist movement, while related in its emphasis on observable consequences, proceeds upon a more radical methodological foundation. Its central thesis is that all knowledge in psychology must be derived from external observation. Introspection—so the argument runs—is not a valid method, because it purports to give access to a private realm inaccessible to others, and therefore incapable of verification. The behaviourist does not necessarily deny that internal mental events occur; what he denies is that such events can be known scientifically. Since they are not open to observation by more than one observer, they cannot enter into the domain of public, verifiable knowledge. Hence, they are excluded from psychology as a science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychology, according to this view, must confine itself exclusively to behaviour—by which is meant what organisms do, not what they are alleged to think or feel. Behaviour is the only datum that can be accurately recorded, measured, and reproduced. The possibility that thought may accompany behaviour is not denied; but such a possibility cannot be established by observation. Indeed, in their investigations of human conduct, behaviourists report that they have found no observable evidence of thought as a distinct process. When people speak, they believe they are thinking; but the behaviourist maintains that speech can be fully accounted for without postulating thought at all. In behaviourist literature, therefore, discussion of “thought processes” is systematically replaced by discussion of “The Language Habit.” This substitution—treating language not as an expression of inner cognition but as a conditioned response—is found to be remarkably effective in explaining the facts of human verbal behaviour. Watson’s *Behavior: an Introduction to Comparative Psychology* (1914) may be cited as a fundamental text in which this standpoint is elaborated with considerable thoroughness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to understand that behaviourism did not arise out of any contempt for human intelligence, nor from a desire to reduce man to the level of a machine. On the contrary, it emerged from patient study of animal behaviour—a field in which the temptation to anthropomorphize has long been strong. The question whether animals “think” has excited popular interest for generations; but those who take sides in the controversy often do so without defining what they mean by thinking. Scientists who wished to approach the matter seriously began to observe animal actions in order to infer the presence or absence of mental processes. At first glance, such inferences may appear justified. A dog comes when called: it is said to “know” its name. It shows signs of sorrow when its master is absent, and exhibits joy—tail-wagging, barking, leaping—upon his return: it is said to “remember” him. These are observable facts. But the interpretation of these facts in mental terms—of “knowing,” “remembering,” and so forth—is an inference, and one that becomes increasingly questionable under scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "As careful observers have accumulated more data, they have found that many complex and apparently purposeful actions in animals can be explained without assuming any foresight or conscious intention. A bird builds its first nest with no prior experience, yet the structure is perfectly adapted to holding eggs, incubation, and rearing young. But there is no evidence that the bird foresees any of these outcomes—that it desires eggs, or anticipates hatching, or imagines the needs of its future offspring. It acts under the impulse of instinct, not under the guidance of purpose. The behaviour is adaptive, but not because it is directed toward an end conceived in advance. As Lloyd Morgan observes in his *Instinct and Experience* (1912, chapter ii), the question whether instinctive actions involve prevision must be met with extreme caution; and the balance of evidence suggests that they do not. The more rigorous the method of observation, the more the tendency has been to describe animal behaviour in purely external terms, avoiding all attribution of consciousness or thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is this method that the behaviourists propose to extend to human beings. If we are to have a scientific psychology, they argue, we must apply the same standards to ourselves that we apply to animals. We must explain human behaviour by reference only to what can be externally observed. To illustrate the principle, though not necessarily the subtlety of the actual doctrine, consider the following simplified case: two children are asked, “What is six times nine?” One answers “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.” The first is said to know the answer, the second does not. But what is the observable difference? Simply this: the first child has acquired the habit of uttering the verbal response “fifty-four” when the auditory or visual stimulus “six times nine” is presented; the second has not. The correct answer is not, from the behaviourist standpoint, evidence of thought; it is evidence of a well-formed language habit. The process is comparable to that of a horse turning into its accustomed stable when it reaches a familiar corner: the behaviour is learned, reliable, and appropriate, but there is no need to suppose that the horse forms an image of the stable, or desires it, or thinks about it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with human knowledge as tested in examinations. The examination is an experimental procedure designed to elicit certain observable responses. What is observed is not thought, but behaviour—written or spoken answers. The examiner does not, and cannot, observe the inner processes of the examinee. He has no means of knowing whether the correct answer was accompanied by any mental activity whatever. From the scientific point of view, such activity is irrelevant. The examiner is concerned only with whether the right response occurs. And even the most successful candidate may, for all we can tell, have produced the correct answers automatically, without a moment’s reflection. The behaviourist does not deny that thinking may occur; he merely insists that, since it cannot be observed, it cannot form part of a scientific account of human conduct. His task is to explain behaviour in terms of stimuli and responses, habits and associations—leaving the inner theatre, if it exists, to metaphysicians and poets, but not to psychologists.\n",

      "In the early 20th century, a significant movement in psychology emerged known as behaviourism, championed most prominently by Professor John B. Watson of Johns Hopkins University. While figures like John Dewey, William James, and F.C.S. Schiller are more typically associated with pragmatism—one of whose founding trios Dewey belonged to—the broader philosophical currents linking empirical observation to knowledge laid groundwork that behaviourism would later radicalize. At its core, behaviourism rests on a strict epistemological principle: scientific knowledge in psychology must be derived solely from what can be externally observed. This position leads behaviourists to reject introspection as a valid method. They do not necessarily deny that internal mental experiences occur, but they insist that such phenomena are inaccessible to objective observation and therefore fall outside the scope of scientific inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, behaviourists argue that psychology should concern itself exclusively with behaviour—defined as observable actions, particularly those involving movement, speech, and response to stimuli. Since internal states like thoughts or feelings cannot be directly measured or verified by others, they are deemed irrelevant to the scientific study of the mind. The only reliable data, according to this view, are behavioural responses that can be recorded, replicated, and analyzed under controlled conditions. Even the possibility that thought accompanies behaviour cannot be confirmed through observation, and thus cannot be considered part of a scientific explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach did not arise from skepticism about human intelligence or from a desire to reduce human complexity. Rather, it was inspired by the study of animal behaviour, where the question of whether non-human animals \"think\" has long stirred debate. Often, people attribute mental states—such as knowing, remembering, or intending—to animals based on their actions, yet without clearly defining what \"thinking\" actually means. Early researchers attempted to infer mental capacities in animals by observing their responses. For instance, a dog coming when called is said to \"know\" its name; a dog displaying excitement upon its owner’s return is believed to \"remember\" them. These emotional and responsive behaviours are indeed observable facts. But the interpretations—that the dog *knows* or *remembers*—are inferences, not data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon closer examination, such inferences begin to unravel. Consider a bird building a nest for the first time. The structure may be perfectly suited for holding eggs, incubation, and raising chicks, but there is no observable evidence that the bird anticipates any of these outcomes. It does not appear to act out of desire, foresight, or intention. Instead, its behaviour is better explained as the result of instinctive impulses shaped by evolution. As Lloyd Morgan argued in his 1912 work *Instinct and Experience*, particularly in Chapter II, instinctive actions do not require prevision; they are triggered by stimuli and carried out without conscious planning. Over time, careful observers of animals have moved away from mentalistic interpretations, choosing instead to describe behaviour in purely mechanistic and observable terms—avoiding assumptions about consciousness or inner experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was this methodological rigor in animal studies that behaviourists proposed should be extended to the study of human beings. If we refrain from attributing thought to animals based on their actions, why should we assume it in humans without equivalent evidence? To illustrate this point, consider a simple example: two children are asked, “What is six times nine?” One answers “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.” Conventionally, we say the first child knows the answer and the second does not. But from a behaviourist standpoint, the only observable difference is the presence or absence of a specific verbal habit. The first child has learned to produce the correct verbal response; the second has not. The correct answer is not proof of thought—it is evidence of a learned association, much like a horse turning into its usual stable when approaching a familiar corner. Both are instances of conditioned behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this light, human knowledge, as it is tested and evaluated—say, in an examination—reduces to a set of observable verbal or behavioural habits. The examiner observes only what the student says or writes, not what (if anything) goes on internally. There is no way to observe the thought process behind a correct answer, nor is there any scientific basis for assuming that thinking occurred at all. Even the most successful examinee might simply be reproducing memorized responses without conscious reflection. From the behaviourist perspective, the examiner has no interest in—and no access to—the inner world of the examinee. What matters is the output: the behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, behaviourism does not deny the existence of internal experience outright, but it insists that such phenomena, if they exist, are beyond the reach of science. The discipline of psychology, to be truly scientific, must restrict itself to what is publicly observable and objectively measurable. As articulated in Watson’s 1914 work *Behavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology*, this method—rooted in the careful study of animals and extended to humans—offers a more rigorous and reliable foundation for understanding behaviour. By replacing vague notions like “thought processes” with precise descriptions of “language habits,” behaviourism aims to transform psychology into a science grounded in evidence, not speculation.\n",

      "\n",
      "They deny the validity of introspection as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge. It is not that they claim no inner mental life exists; rather, they argue that introspection does not yield information about oneself that could not, in principle, be observed in others. If a mental event is truly private and unobservable by others, then it lies outside the domain of scientific inquiry. Therefore, even if internal mental events occur, they are not accessible to objective verification. And since science depends on public, repeatable observation, such events cannot form the basis of psychological theory.  \n",

      "\n",
      "In behaviourist literature, discussion of “thought processes” is systematically replaced by discussion of “the language habit.” This shift—from attributing behaviour to internal reasoning to explaining it as a learned response—is not merely terminological. It is found to be highly effective in accounting for human verbal behaviour. Watson’s 1914 work, *Behavior: an Introduction to Comparative Psychology*, provides a foundational statement of this view, grounding it in the study of animal behaviour rather than human introspection.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, behaviourism did not arise from reflections on human error or foolishness. It emerged instead from the systematic study of animals. The question of whether animals “think” has long been debated in popular discourse, often without clarity about what “thinking” means. Researchers interested in animal minds began by observing behaviour to infer mental states. At first, such inferences may seem plausible. A dog comes when called, and so it is said to “know” its name. A dog shows signs of distress in its master’s absence and excitement upon return, and so it is said to “remember” him. These emotional reactions are observable facts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But the claims that the dog “knows” or “remembers” are interpretations—mentalistic inferences built upon behaviour. And these inferences grow increasingly questionable under scrutiny. In many cases of complex animal behaviour that appear purposeful, there is no evidence that the animal anticipates the outcome. Consider a bird building its first nest. It constructs an intricate structure suited to holding eggs, incubating them, and sheltering hatchlings. Yet there is no reason to suppose the bird foresees any of this. It does not act because it desires eggs or expects them to hatch. Its behaviour is better explained as the expression of instinctive impulses, shaped by evolution, rather than as the result of foresight or intention.  \n",

Careful observers of animal behaviour, seeking to avoid unwarranted assumptions, have therefore moved toward descriptions that do not invoke consciousness or thought. Instead, they describe what the animal *does*—its movements, responses, and adaptations—without attributing internal states.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The behaviourists propose that the same method should be applied to human beings. Just as we can explain a dog’s response to its name without assuming it “understands,” so too can we explain human speech and action without assuming thought. To illustrate this—though the example is admittedly simplified, even crude, compared to the actual arguments of Watson and his followers—consider two children asked, “What is six times nine?” One says “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "The first is said to “know” the answer; the second does not. But the only observable difference between them is the presence or absence of a particular language habit. The first child has learned to produce the verbal response “six times nine is fifty-four”; the second has not. The correct answer is not evidence of thought; it is evidence of training. The production of the correct response is comparable to a horse turning into its usual stable upon reaching a familiar fork in the road. Both are instances of learned behaviour, shaped by repetition and reinforcement, not necessarily involving any internal process of calculation or understanding.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Human knowledge, as tested in examinations, is thus an observable fact—not of mind, but of behaviour. Examinations function as experiments designed to detect the presence of certain verbal or behavioural habits. What is observed is not thought, but speech, writing, or action. The examiner does not—and cannot—observe the mental processes of the examinee. Those processes, if they exist, are irrelevant to the assessment. The examiner has no basis for assuming that a correct answer reflects thought any more than a wrong answer reflects ignorance. From the behaviourist standpoint, even the most successful examinee may have produced the right response without engaging in a single act of thinking.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The methodological point is clear: psychology must restrict itself to what can be publicly observed. Internal events, if they occur, are scientifically irrelevant unless they manifest in behaviour. The behaviourist does not deny that people may have thoughts; he denies only that thoughts can be the subject of scientific psychology unless they are expressed in observable actions. And since language is itself a form of behaviour, even our most abstract reasoning can be studied as a habit, not as a window into an unobservable mind.  \n",

It insists that explanations in psychology be built on evidence that can be verified, repeated, and tested—on facts that are external, objective, and measurable.

      "**THE PLACE OF STUDENT INITIATIVE IN EDUCATION**\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a principle of the first importance in education that student initiative should be developed to the fullest possible extent. This is not merely a matter of pedagogical efficiency; it is a condition of mental independence and intellectual integrity. Maria Montessori, in her work with young children, showed how even infants can learn to govern their own actions when given an environment suited to free exploration and self-chosen activity. Her results are impressive, not only for their success in promoting early discipline and concentration, but for the way they anticipate a broader truth: that the mind grows most vigorously when it is active, not passive. Yet while her methods are admirably adapted to early childhood, they cannot be mechanically extended to older students. As the child matures, the forms of initiative must change; what is needed is not imitation of the nursery-school, but the development of new techniques suited to the expanding powers of reason, judgment, and self-direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among progressive educators, there is a growing consensus that the balance between class-work and individual work must be radically shifted. The traditional model, in which all students are compelled to follow the same routine at the same pace, under centralized instruction, fails to recognize the diversity of aptitudes, interests, and rhythms of learning. Instead, the school should become a place where individual work is the norm, though carried on in common—a kind of intellectual workshop in which each student pursues his own inquiries, yet remains in an atmosphere of shared purpose and mutual stimulation. Such a system cannot function without ample and well-equipped libraries and laboratories, accessible at all hours. These are not luxuries; they are as essential to modern education as blackboards once were to the old.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large portion of the school day should be devoted to voluntary, self-directed study. The student must be free to choose his subject, within reasonable limits, and to proceed at his own pace. But freedom does not mean aimlessness. To prevent desultory reading and to fix knowledge in the memory, every such period of study should culminate in the writing of a report. This report should summarize the material acquired, present it in orderly fashion, and, as far as possible, state its implications. The practice serves three ends: it strengthens retention by compelling the student to restate what he has learned; it gives reading a definite goal, transforming it from a passive pastime into an active investigation; and it enables the teacher, without constant surveillance, to follow the student’s progress and offer guidance suited to his particular needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The degree of teacher control should vary with the student’s capacity. The more intelligent and self-reliant a student is, the less direct supervision he requires. But even for those who are less capable, the method of control should be indirect—by suggestion, by inquiry, by the stimulation of thought—never by arbitrary command. The moment a teacher says, “You must do this,” without allowing room for discussion or initiative, he substitutes obedience for intelligence. He may secure temporary compliance, but at the cost of mental passivity. The aim is not to produce well-drilled subordinates, but independent minds capable of judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not mean that there should be no prescribed work. On the contrary, alongside self-directed study, there should be definite assignments. These should require the student to investigate a given topic, to gather facts from reliable sources, and to present them in a coherent and impartial manner. The purpose is not merely to impart information, but to train the student in the methods of research and in the art of clear, organized communication. Such exercises are essential to the formation of a disciplined intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even these elements are insufficient if education remains insulated from the real world. It is a grave error to suppose that young people should be protected from the great controversies of their time—controversies in politics, in society, in theology. To exclude these is to imply that education has nothing to do with life. Worse, it encourages the belief that academic work is a kind of game, disconnected from practical reality. On the contrary, students should be encouraged to examine current issues, not from a single standpoint, but from multiple perspectives. They should be made familiar with arguments on both sides, including those that challenge the orthodox or popular view. If a student holds a strong opinion, he should be required to seek out factual support for it, not merely to repeat slogans or inherited beliefs. And he should be given the opportunity to debate with others who hold opposing views.\n",
      "\n",
      "These debates must be conducted seriously, with the aim of discovering truth, not of securing rhetorical victory. The teacher must take no side, however strongly he may feel. Indeed, if the majority of students incline toward one position, the teacher should deliberately argue the other, making it clear that he does so for the sake of the discussion, not from conviction. His function is limited: to correct demonstrable errors of fact, to ensure that the discussion remains orderly, and to prevent the substitution of emotion for argument. He must not try to shape opinions. The goal is not agreement, but the habit of testing beliefs against evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings us to a fundamental principle: that the scientific attitude should be the ideal presented to students in dealing with practical questions. By this I do not mean only the methods of physics or chemistry, but the general disposition to demand evidence, to weigh arguments, to accept conclusions only when they are warranted. It is a disposition rare in politics, where myth and passion so often take the place of reason. Yet it is precisely this habit that education should seek to cultivate. Students should learn to distinguish between a genuine argument, based on verifiable facts, and a mere expression of prejudice or emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For myth-making is one of the most dangerous by-products of intense partisanship. In politics, in religion, in social conflict, people construct elaborate systems of belief that insulate them from reality. Two extremes are especially to be feared: first, the submergence of intellect by passion, in which feeling becomes so intense that it distorts perception; and second, the suppression of passion by intellect, in which the mind becomes so detached that it loses all concern for human ends. The first is common among the masses; the second among intellectuals. Both are distortions. Passion is not to be condemned, provided it is directed toward constructive goals. Intellect is valuable only when it serves such ends, not when it remains a sterile exercise in abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The root of the trouble lies in a widespread tendency to live in a world of subjectivity—to believe what one wishes to believe, rather than what the evidence shows. This is the psychological mechanism behind all forms of delusion: hysteria, nationalist myth, theological dogma, class prejudice. It is a retreat into fantasy, adopted when reality fails to satisfy desire. And it is a weakness not confined to the uneducated. Indeed, it is often most elaborate among those who pride themselves on their rationality.\n",
      "\n",
      "A central illustration of this is Don Quixote. On his first attempt to make a helmet, he tested it and found it defective. On his second attempt, he did not test it; he merely *deemed* it good. From that point on, his life was governed by the habit of “deeming”—of accepting as true whatever suited his imagination, without regard to fact. To refuse to confront an unpleasant truth is to act in the same way. All of us, to some degree, are Don Quixotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early childhood, such subjectivity is natural and even necessary. Children are powerless; their fancies are a refuge. But as they grow, they must learn that dreams are of value only in so far as they can be realized. The transition to maturity is marked by the growing capacity to test ideals against reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the school, this transition can be aided by the natural skepticism of boys, who are quick to challenge exaggerated claims about one another’s prowess. In personal matters, it is hard to maintain illusions in the face of peers. But in larger domains—school, nation, class—myths flourish, often with the encouragement of teachers and authorities. The belief that one’s own school is the best in the world, that one’s country is always in the right, that one’s social class is inherently superior—these are not innocent sentiments. They are dangerous delusions, maintained by emotional comfort and institutional reinforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequences are serious. Those who believe they have a strong helmet will not notice when it is easily cut through by a sword. They grow lazy, complacent, unprepared. And when reality finally intrudes, the result is not merely disappointment, but disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The psychological foundation of this habit is fear. Fear prevents people from seeing dangers clearly. A man who hears “fire” in the night may tell himself it is the neighbor’s house, because to accept the truth would be too terrifying. So he delays, and perishes. This extreme case is pathological, but its analogues are common in public life. Governments ignore approaching crises, nations blind themselves to their weaknesses, classes deny their decline—all because the truth is too painful to face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the need for rational prevision to take the place of fear. Fear paralyzes; foresight enables action. The mature mind should be able to anticipate avoidable evils without being overwhelmed by dread. Intelligence should be used to prevent what can be prevented. Inevitable suffering must be met with courage—but the focus here is on the harms that are avoidable, yet go unaddressed because people cannot bear to acknowledge them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task of education, especially in the later years, is to combat this weakness. This requires two complementary efforts: first, to strengthen the student’s belief in what can be achieved through effort and reason; and second, to sharpen his sensitivity to the way reality can shatter illusions. Together, these form the principle of living objectively—of acting in the world as it is, not as one would wish it to be. This is not a cold or indifferent life. It is one in which passion and intellect are balanced, each correcting the\n",

      "In a truly progressive education, student initiative must be cultivated and maximized. This principle, famously demonstrated by Maria Montessori in her work with very young children, reveals how deeply capable even the youngest learners are when given the freedom to explore and direct their own learning. However, as students grow older, new methods are required—methods that respect their increasing intellectual independence while guiding them toward responsible, thoughtful engagement with knowledge and the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most important shifts in such an educational model is the move away from rigid, teacher-led class instruction toward a greater emphasis on individual work. Progressive educators widely agree that students learn best when they are actively engaged in self-directed study, rather than passively receiving information in a uniform group setting. This does not mean isolation, however. Individual work should take place in a shared, collaborative environment—a well-organized study hall, a spacious library, or a well-equipped laboratory—where students are surrounded by peers also immersed in their own inquiries. Such spaces foster a culture of focused, autonomous learning, supported by the quiet energy of collective effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within this framework, a significant portion of the school day should be dedicated to voluntary, self-directed study. But this freedom must be structured: students should be required to document their learning by writing reports that summarize their findings. This practice serves multiple essential purposes. First, it helps solidify knowledge in memory through active recall and synthesis. Second, it gives reading a clear objective, transforming what might otherwise be aimless or desultory browsing into purposeful inquiry. And third, it allows teachers to maintain a light but meaningful presence—offering tailored guidance, asking probing questions, and ensuring that each student remains on a productive path, all without resorting to heavy-handed control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The degree of teacher involvement should vary according to the student’s ability. More capable learners require less supervision, thriving on independence and the challenge of intellectual autonomy. Less confident or less skilled students, meanwhile, benefit from more support—not through commands or rigid directives, but through thoughtful suggestions, open-ended questions, and the stimulation of curiosity. The goal is not to dictate answers, but to guide students toward discovering them for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside this self-directed work, students must also engage in structured assignments. These should involve investigating facts on a prescribed topic and then organizing and presenting those facts coherently. Such exercises develop crucial skills in research, critical analysis, and structured communication—abilities that are foundational for lifelong learning and responsible civic participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "An education that stops at technical skills, however, is incomplete. Students must also be encouraged to grapple with the pressing controversies of their time—issues in politics, society, and even theology that divide opinion and shape the world around them. They should be exposed not just to the dominant or orthodox view, but to multiple perspectives, learning to understand opposing arguments on their own terms. When students hold strong opinions, they should be taught how to ground them in evidence, to seek out verifiable facts, and to defend their positions with reason rather than emotion. And they should participate in debates with peers who hold different views—not as performances of rhetoric, but as genuine attempts to uncover truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "These debates must be conducted seriously, with integrity and intellectual humility. Teachers must resist the temptation to take sides, even when they personally feel strongly about an issue. If a particular view dominates the classroom, the teacher should deliberately argue the opposing side, making it clear that this is done not to convert, but to test ideas. The teacher’s role is strictly limited: to correct factual errors, to challenge logical fallacies, and to ensure that the discussion remains grounded in evidence—not to shape opinions. The aim is not victory, but clarity; not persuasion, but understanding. Through this practice, students learn that dialogue is not a tool for domination, but a method for discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding such controversial subjects is a mistake, as is using the classroom as a platform for propaganda. Both extremes fail students. Education should not be insulated from the real world, nor should it be a vehicle for ideological indoctrination. Instead, students must come to see that their academic work is directly connected to the challenges and responsibilities of practical life. This connection gives learning meaning and urgency. And it requires teachers to set aside their personal convictions, not out of neutrality, but out of respect for the student’s developing mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal that should guide this entire process is a scientific attitude toward practical questions—one that values evidence, demands verifiable claims, and insists on genuine argument over emotional assertion. This habit of mind is rare, especially in the realm of politics, where myth and partisanship so often prevail. Intense political loyalty, in particular, tends to generate powerful myths—narratives that insulate believers from inconvenient truths, creating self-reinforcing echo chambers where reality is distorted or denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two emotional extremes undermine this scientific ideal. On one hand, passion can overwhelm intellect, leading to dogmatism and blind fervor. On the other, intellect can suppress passion entirely, especially among intellectuals who pride themselves on cold rationality, resulting in detachment and ineffectiveness. Both extremes are harmful. Passion is not the enemy—it is essential, so long as it is constructive rather than destructive. Intellect, too, is vital, but only when it serves practical, humane ends. The mind must serve the heart objectively, not retreat into abstraction or fantasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For when reality fails to meet our hopes, there is a natural human tendency to retreat into illusion. This tendency takes many forms: hysteria, nationalist myth, theological dogma, or class-based superiority. All are expressions of a deeper weakness—a refusal to live objectively. This is the core challenge of later education: not merely to impart knowledge, but to combat this subjective way of thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two complementary strategies are needed. First, students must be empowered—given a genuine belief in what can be achieved in the real world. Second, they must be sensitized to how reality can and will challenge their assumptions. Together, these form the discipline of living objectively: acting based on what is true, not merely on what one wishes were true.\n",
      "\n",
      "A powerful illustration of the opposite—the life lived subjectively—is Don Quixote. On his first attempt to forge a helmet, he tests it and finds it flawed. On the second, he forgoes testing and simply *deems* it perfect. His entire life is governed by this habit: believing things are true because he wants them to be, not because they are. Refusing to confront unpleasant facts is the same habit in all of us. We all have Quixotic tendencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early childhood, living in fantasy is natural and even necessary—children are powerless, and imagination compensates for limitation. But as we approach adulthood, we must learn that dreams have value only if they can be realized in action. Schools can help by fostering environments where personal delusions are naturally challenged. Boys, for example, instinctively test each other’s boasts; in a well-run school, it’s hard to maintain inflated ideas of one’s own abilities in the face of peer reality-testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet myth persists—often encouraged by authority figures. Students are taught that their school is the best, that their country is always right, that their social class is inherently superior. These are dangerous illusions. They create the belief in a strong defense—a “good helmet”—when in fact the armor is fragile, easily pierced by the sword of reality. Such myths breed complacency, discourage effort, and ultimately lead to disaster when the unprepared meet the inevitable demands of the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the root of this denial is fear. Fear prevents people from seeing danger clearly. A person who hears “fire” at night might assume it’s the neighbor’s house burning—because to believe it’s their own home is too terrifying. This instinct, while understandable, leads to paralysis and missed escape. In politics, the same dynamic plays out on a grand scale: societies ignore looming crises because acknowledging them is too painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The antidote is not the suppression of emotion, but the cultivation of rational foresight. We must learn to anticipate negative outcomes clearly and calmly, without being overwhelmed by fear. Intelligence should be used not to deny danger, but to avoid it. Inevitable suffering must be faced with courage—but preventable harm should be prevented. And that requires the courage to see the truth, even when it is uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the ultimate goal of education is not just knowledge, but character: the strength to live in reality, to act with purpose, and to meet the world as it is—not as we wish it to be.\n",

      "The proper balance lies in constructive passion guided by objective intellect. Passion is acceptable, even necessary, when it aims at achievable ends. Intellect is valuable when it serves such ends—not as an escape into abstraction, but as a practical instrument. When reality fails to meet expectations, people often retreat into fantasy. This tendency manifests as hysteria, nationalist myth, theological dogma, or class-based superiority. It is a form of subjective thinking—a weakness of character that education must counteract.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key aim of later education should therefore be to combat this tendency. Two complementary strategies are required. First, students must be helped to believe in what can be achieved in the real world. Second, they must become more sensitive to how reality can challenge and dismantle their illusions. Together, these constitute the principle of living objectively rather than subjectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don Quixote offers a vivid illustration of subjective thinking. On his first attempt to make a helmet, he tested it and damaged it. On the second attempt, he did not test it; he merely deemed it good. His life was governed by this habit—of assuming truth without verification. Refusing to confront unpleasant facts is the same mental act on a larger scale. All people exhibit Quixotic tendencies to some degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early childhood, living in fancies is normal and acceptable, since children are genuinely powerless. But as individuals approach adulthood, they must learn that dreams have value only if they can eventually be realized. In school, boys often test each other’s claims through challenge and competition; personal delusions about one’s abilities are hard to sustain in such environments. Yet myth-making persists in broader domains—often reinforced by authority figures such as teachers or national leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples include the belief that one’s own school is the best in the world, that one’s country is always right and always victorious, or that one’s social class—especially if wealthy—is inherently superior. These are not harmless sentiments. They lead people to believe they possess strong defenses—a “good helmet”—when in fact they are vulnerable. Such myths encourage complacency and, ultimately, disaster when reality strikes and preparation is lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The psychological root of this behavior is fear. Fear prevents people from acknowledging real dangers. Consider someone who hears “fire” at night but assumes the danger lies next door—because accepting the truth is too frightening. The result is inaction, missed escape, and preventable harm. While such a reaction may be extreme, its analogues are widespread in politics and society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fear is counterproductive when rational thought is needed. What is required instead is rational prevision—the ability to foresee negative outcomes without being paralyzed by dread. Intelligence should be used to avoid avoidable harms. Inevitable evils must be met with courage, but the focus here is on those dangers that could be prevented if only they were acknowledged in time. The task of education is not to eliminate fear, but to ensure it does not override reason. The goal is to produce individuals who can face reality clearly, act wisely, and live not in service to illusion, but in pursuit of truth.\n",

      "There is, in the best educational thinking of our time, a growing recognition that the initiative of the student must be made the central axis around which the whole enterprise of instruction revolves. It is not enough that a child should be passively filled, like a vessel, with pre-selected facts; nor is it sufficient that he should merely repeat, parrot-like, what his elders have decreed to be true. He must be an active agent in his own development. Maria Montessori, with a rare insight into the springs of youthful curiosity, showed how even the very young—those tender minds not yet hardened by convention—may be trusted with a surprising degree of autonomy, provided the environment is carefully prepared and the adult assumes not the role of master but of discreet guide. Yet we must not suppose that the methods suitable for infants can be mechanically extended to adolescents or young adults. The growing mind demands ever more complex forms of liberty, and with maturity comes the need for a more deliberate structure within which initiative may flourish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the more enlightened educators of the present age, there is broad agreement that the old regime of rigid class-work—where all pupils were compelled to march in lockstep through a uniform curriculum at a uniform pace—should give way to a greater emphasis on individual effort. This does not mean isolation, nor does it imply a licence for idleness. On the contrary, the ideal is a community of independent workers, each pursuing his own inquiries in a shared space—a large, well-lit hall, say, where the silence is broken only by the turning of pages or the scratch of pens—each aware of the others’ presence, each stimulated by the general atmosphere of concentrated application. Such a model presupposes, however, certain material conditions: spacious libraries, well-equipped laboratories, access to instruments and texts. These are not luxuries, but necessities—for knowledge cannot be freely pursued if the means of pursuit are deliberately withheld.\n",
      "\n",
      "A substantial portion of the school day ought to be devoted to voluntary, self-directed study. This is not a period of relaxation or indulgence; it is, rather, the very crucible of intellectual growth. The student chooses his subject—within certain broad limits—and applies himself to mastering it. But reading must not be desultory, nor learning left to evaporate in the heat of momentary interest. He must write: that is, he must summarize what he has learned, organize it, express it in his own words. This practice serves three valuable ends. First, it fixes knowledge in the memory: the act of writing compels precision and thus strengthens retention. Second, it gives reading a purpose; the student no longer drifts from book to book, grazing aimlessly, but reads with a view to producing an account, and hence reads with attention. Third, it enables the teacher to exercise a light but effective supervision—light, because it does not consist in constant interference; effective, because it allows the teacher to discern the student’s progress, his difficulties, his aptitudes, and to offer help where it is genuinely needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The degree of control exercised by the teacher must vary, naturally, with the student’s capacity. The able and industrious youth requires little more than occasional suggestion, a hint as to where further light may be found. For the slower or less confident, more guidance is necessary—but even here, command should be eschewed. The teacher must not bark orders, as though education were a form of military drill. Instead, he should guide by inquiry, by provoking thought, by stimulating curiosity. He should say, “Have you considered this?” or “What would happen if?” rather than “Do this now.” The habit of unquestioning obedience is fatal to intelligence; the habit of inquiry, once established, is self-sustaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet self-directed work must not be the only mode. Alongside it, there should be set assignments—tasks in which the subject is prescribed, but the method of investigation is left to the student. He is to inquire into the facts concerning a given topic, and then present those facts in an orderly, intelligible fashion. The purpose here is not to test mere memory, but to cultivate two essential skills: the ability to discover reliable information, and the ability to communicate it clearly. These are not merely academic virtues; they are the foundation of all serious engagement with the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that, indeed, is the point: education should prepare the young not for examinations, but for life. It is therefore imperative that they be introduced to the great controversies of their time—political, social, theological. They must not be sheltered from these matters, nor fed exclusively upon the orthodox or conventional view. They should be exposed to opposing arguments, fairly presented; and if they themselves hold strong opinions, they should be taught how to support them with verifiable facts. Moreover, they should debate—seriously, respectfully, with a genuine desire to understand. Such debates must not be mere exhibitions of rhetorical skill, contests in which victory is the only aim. The goal is not to win, but to discover what is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "In these debates, the teacher must maintain strict neutrality. He must not, even by a glance or an inflection of voice, betray his own convictions. If the current of opinion in the class runs strongly in one direction, it becomes his duty to argue the other side—not because he believes in it, but because the balance of inquiry must be preserved. He should make this explicit: “I am now taking the opposite view for the sake of argument.” His role is limited to correcting demonstrable errors of fact; he must not seek to influence opinions. The object is not to produce disciples, but independent minds capable of using discussion as an instrument of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a mistake, common among timorous educators, to suppose that by avoiding controversial topics one preserves peace or neutrality. Such avoidance is itself a form of propaganda: it teaches the student that these matters are either unimportant or too dangerous to examine. Worse still is the practice—only too common—of using the classroom as a pulpit for the teacher’s own beliefs. The proper aim is neither avoidance nor indoctrination, but preparation: the student should come to see that his studies are not a detached intellectual exercise, but a training for responsible citizenship. When this connection is made, academic work ceases to seem abstract or pointless; it becomes, instead, a necessary apprenticeship in the art of living wisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal that should be held before the student is that of the scientific attitude—not in the narrow sense of laboratory experiment, but in the broader sense of a mind that demands evidence, that weighs arguments, that is willing to change its opinion in the face of new facts. He should learn to present real reasons for his beliefs, and to expect the same from others. This habit is rare, especially in political life, where emotion so often masquerades as argument and myth is preferred to analysis. Yet it is indispensable for any society that hopes to avoid disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "For intense political partisanship, like religious fanaticism, tends to generate myths—elaborate systems of belief that insulate their holders from contact with reality. In such systems, inconvenient facts are ignored, opponents are caricatured, and every event is interpreted as a confirmation of prior dogma. Two extremes are especially to be feared. On the one hand, passion may so overpower intellect that reason is silenced; on the other, intellect may suppress passion altogether, producing the cold, detached cynic who sees through everything but believes in nothing. Both are deformations of human nature. Passion is not to be despised; it is the source of all action, all creation, all love. But it must be disciplined by intelligence. And intelligence, for its part, must be warmed and directed by passion—though not by blind passion, but by that which is constructive, generous, and forward-looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too often, when reality disappoints, men retreat into fantasy. They construct elaborate systems in which their desires are taken as facts. This is a form of hysteria, whether it takes the shape of nationalist delusions, theological dogmatism, or class arrogance. It is, at bottom, a weakness of character—a refusal to endure the discomfort of uncertainty, the pain of disillusionment. And it is against this weakness that education in the later years must be directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two complementary aims must be pursued. First, the student must be helped to believe in the possibility of achievement—that is, in the power of human effort to shape the world. Second, he must be taught to test his beliefs against reality, to accept the correction of experience, to recognize when his hopes have outrun the facts. The union of these two dispositions is the essence of objectivity—the determination to see things as they are, not as we wish them to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider Don Quixote. On his first attempt to forge a helmet, he tested it—and the blow of the sword dented it grievously. But on the second attempt, he did not test it; he merely deemed it good. And so it was with his entire life: he did not verify, he deemed. To refuse to confront an unpleasant truth is to act in the spirit of Don Quixote. We all do it, to some extent; indeed, in early childhood, such subjectivity is not only excusable but inevitable, since the child’s power to affect the world is so slight. But as one approaches adulthood, the test must become ever more rigorous: dreams are not to be abandoned, but they must be brought into relation with what is actually possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rough-and-tumble of school life, boys naturally challenge one another’s boasts. It is difficult, in such a setting, to maintain delusions about one’s prowess at games or fighting. But myths persist in other spheres—especially those where authority protects them. The belief that one’s own school is the finest in the land, that one’s country is always in the right, that one’s class is inherently superior—these are not tested, and therefore not corrected. They are accepted because teachers repeat\n",

      "There is a school of psychology known as behaviourism, with Professor John B. Watson—formerly of Johns Hopkins University—as its most prominent advocate. John Dewey is also broadly associated with this tradition, though his position is more nuanced. Dewey, along with William James and F.C.S. Schiller, was one of the three founders of pragmatism, a philosophical movement concerned with the practical consequences of belief. But the behaviourists, particularly in their more radical form, go further: they insist that knowledge in psychology can be obtained only through external observation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They deny the validity of introspection as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge. It is not that they claim no inner mental life exists; rather, they argue that introspection does not yield information about oneself that could not, in principle, be observed in others. If a mental event is truly private and unobservable by others, then it lies outside the domain of scientific inquiry. Therefore, even if internal mental events occur, they are not accessible to objective verification. And since science depends on public, repeatable observation, such events cannot form the basis of psychological theory.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Psychology, according to the behaviourists, must concern itself exclusively with behaviour—understood as what organisms *do*, not what they are alleged to feel, think, or intend. Behaviour is the only aspect of psychological phenomena that can be accurately observed and measured. The possibility that thought accompanies behaviour cannot be confirmed through observation; in fact, behaviourists report that in their studies of human actions, they have found no observable evidence of thought as a distinct process. While people speak, write, and solve problems, and while they believe these activities demonstrate thinking, the behaviourists argue that such behaviour can be explained without positing any internal cognitive mechanism.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In behaviourist literature, discussion of “thought processes” is systematically replaced by discussion of “the language habit.” This shift—from attributing behaviour to internal reasoning to explaining it as a learned response—is not merely terminological. It is found to be highly effective in accounting for human verbal behaviour. Watson’s 1914 work, *Behavior: an Introduction to Comparative Psychology*, provides a foundational statement of this view, grounding it in the study of animal behaviour rather than human introspection.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, behaviourism did not arise from reflections on human error or foolishness. It emerged instead from the systematic study of animals. The question of whether animals “think” has long been debated in popular discourse, often without clarity about what “thinking” means. Researchers interested in animal minds began by observing behaviour to infer mental states. At first, such inferences may seem plausible. A dog comes when called, and so it is said to “know” its name. A dog shows signs of distress in its master’s absence and excitement upon return, and so it is said to “remember” him. These emotional reactions are observable facts.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But the claims that the dog “knows” or “remembers” are interpretations—mentalistic inferences built upon behaviour. And these inferences grow increasingly questionable under scrutiny. In many cases of complex animal behaviour that appear purposeful, there is no evidence that the animal anticipates the outcome. Consider a bird building its first nest. It constructs an intricate structure suited to holding eggs, incubating them, and sheltering hatchlings. Yet there is no reason to suppose the bird foresees any of this. It does not act because it desires eggs or expects them to hatch. Its behaviour is better explained as the expression of instinctive impulses, shaped by evolution, rather than as the result of foresight or intention.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As Lloyd Morgan argued in his 1912 work *Instinct and Experience* (chapter ii), instinctive actions need not involve prevision. Careful observers of animal behaviour, seeking to avoid unwarranted assumptions, have therefore moved toward descriptions that do not invoke consciousness or thought. Instead, they describe what the animal *does*—its movements, responses, and adaptations—without attributing internal states.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The behaviourists propose that the same method should be applied to human beings. Just as we can explain a dog’s response to its name without assuming it “understands,” so too can we explain human speech and action without assuming thought. To illustrate this—though the example is admittedly simplified, even crude, compared to the actual arguments of Watson and his followers—consider two children asked, “What is six times nine?” One says “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.”  \n",
      "\n",
      "The first is said to “know” the answer; the second does not. But the only observable difference between them is the presence or absence of a particular language habit. The first child has learned to produce the verbal response “six times nine is fifty-four”; the second has not. The correct answer is not evidence of thought; it is evidence of training. The production of the correct response is comparable to a horse turning into its usual stable upon reaching a familiar fork in the road. Both are instances of learned behaviour, shaped by repetition and reinforcement, not necessarily involving any internal process of calculation or understanding.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Human knowledge, as tested in examinations, is thus an observable fact—not of mind, but of behaviour. Examinations function as experiments designed to detect the presence of certain verbal or behavioural habits. What is observed is not thought, but speech, writing, or action. The examiner does not—and cannot—observe the mental processes of the examinee. Those processes, if they exist, are irrelevant to the assessment. The examiner has no basis for assuming that a correct answer reflects thought any more than a wrong answer reflects ignorance. From the behaviourist standpoint, even the most successful examinee may have produced the right response without engaging in a single act of thinking.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The methodological point is clear: psychology must restrict itself to what can be publicly observed. Internal events, if they occur, are scientifically irrelevant unless they manifest in behaviour. The behaviourist does not deny that people may have thoughts; he denies only that thoughts can be the subject of scientific psychology unless they are expressed in observable actions. And since language is itself a form of behaviour, even our most abstract reasoning can be studied as a habit, not as a window into an unobservable mind.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the behaviourist approach is not a denial of complexity, but a demand for rigor. It insists that explanations in psychology be built on evidence that can be verified, repeated, and tested—on facts that are external, objective, and measurable. In rejecting introspection and mentalistic inference, behaviourism does not reject science; it seeks to make psychology more truly scientific.\n",

      "It is a curious and not altogether encouraging circumstance that the progress of science should so often require the dismantling of what appears, to the untrained mind, self-evident. Among the various intellectual movements of our time, one of the most striking is that school of psychology known as Behaviourism, which, under the vigorous leadership of Professor John B. Watson—formerly of Johns Hopkins University—has undertaken the systematic exclusion of introspection from the domain of scientific inquiry. John Dewey, though less rigid in his formulations, may be said to belong, broadly speaking, to this same general tendency, having, indeed, been one of the three principal architects of Pragmatism, alongside William James and F. C. S. Schiller. But it is Watson who has given the movement its most uncompromising expression, and it is to him, and to the method he represents, that we must turn if we are to understand the radical implications of this doctrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central contention of the Behaviourists is at once simple and devastating to traditional assumptions: knowledge in psychology is to be obtained solely through external observation. They do not, as is sometimes carelessly supposed, deny that internal mental events may occur; they merely insist that such events, if they exist, are not accessible to scientific observation and are therefore irrelevant to the science of psychology. Introspection, that inward gaze so long regarded as the royal road to self-knowledge, is dismissed as a source of error, illusion, and unverifiable assertion. It is not that the Behaviourists claim to disprove the existence of thought or feeling within the individual; rather, they maintain that whatever may transpire behind the veil of privacy cannot be subjected to the rigours of public verification, and thus cannot constitute legitimate data for a discipline aspiring to scientific status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, psychology, as they conceive it, must concern itself exclusively with behaviour—by which is meant, quite simply, what people do. This alone is observable, measurable, and repeatable. The possibility that thought may accompany action is, from their standpoint, a speculation; and a speculation it remains, since no observer can ever detect thought as such. When we study human beings, we observe their movements, their utterances, their reactions to stimuli. We do not observe their cogitations. And if, in the course of such study, no observable evidence of thought presents itself, then the hypothesis of thought, however seductive, becomes superfluous. Language, for instance—so often taken as the very emblem of rationality—is, in the Behaviourist’s lexicon, not an expression of thought, but a habit, a complex motor response acquired through repetition and conditioning. The phrase “thought processes” is accordingly banished from their literature and replaced by the more neutral and less speculative “The Language Habit.” And it must be admitted that this substitution proves remarkably effective in accounting for verbal behaviour, without the need to invoke any invisible and unobservable inner drama.\n",
      "\n",
      "One might be tempted to suppose that such a doctrine arose from a cynical reflection upon human folly, from the observation of how often men speak without thinking, or even believe they are thinking when in fact they are merely repeating phrases. But this, it appears, was not the origin of Behaviourism. Its roots lie rather in the study of animals—a field in which the temptation to anthropomorphize has long been irresistible, and in which, for that very reason, the need for caution is most acute. The question of whether animals “think” has been debated for centuries, usually without any clear agreement as to what “thinking” might mean. Yet, from the time when observers began to study animal behaviour with something approaching scientific care, a certain discipline emerged: the discipline of describing what is seen, and abstaining from what is merely imagined.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that at first glance, animals often seem to exhibit knowledge, memory, even foresight. A dog comes when called: we say he “knows” his name. He is sorrowful in the absence of his master, and joyful at his return: we say he “remembers” him. But these are inferences, not observations. The facts are only that certain stimuli evoke certain responses. The dog behaves in this way or that; whether he experiences anything analogous to what we call memory or recognition is a matter of conjecture. And as observation has sharpened, such conjectures have come to seem increasingly gratuitous. It has been found, for example, that even the most intricate and apparently purposeful sequences of animal behaviour—such as a bird building its nest for the first time—can be satisfactorily explained without supposing that the animal has any foresight of the result. The bird does not build the nest because it desires eggs, or anticipates the warmth of incubation, or foresees the helpless chirping of fledglings. It builds because it is impelled by instinct, by a chain of inherited reactions to environmental cues. As Lloyd Morgan pointed out, in his *Instinct and Experience* (1912), such actions may be perfectly adaptive without involving prevision. The end is achieved, not because it is foreseen, but because the mechanism is well-designed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is from this foundation in animal psychology that the Behaviourist builds his case for the study of man. If we are to avoid the seductions of unwarranted inference in dealing with dogs and birds, why should we indulge them when dealing with children and scholars? Consider, for example, two children asked the question: “What is six times nine?” One says “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.” The first, we say, knows the answer; the second does not. But what, in point of fact, have we observed? Only this: that one child has acquired the habit of uttering a certain string of words in response to a certain stimulus, and the other has not. The difference is behavioural, not mental. The child who says “fifty-four” may have arrived at the answer through thought, or through memory, or through a lucky guess; or he may have none of these things, but simply repeat a formula drilled into him by rote. The examiner cannot tell, and has no need to tell. What is tested in examinations is not thought, but the presence or absence of certain verbal habits. The examiner observes a response, records it, and judges accordingly. He does not peer into the child’s mind; he cannot. And from the standpoint of science, he need not. Even the most brilliant performance may be, for all we can observe, the product of mechanical association rather than of reflection. Indeed, the most successful examinee may not have thought at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the Behaviourist concludes, psychology must restrict itself to what is publicly observable. It must concern itself with stimuli and responses, with habits and modifications of behaviour, with the conditions under which certain actions occur. It must abstain from all discourse about consciousness, about ideas, about will or understanding—unless these terms can be translated into behavioural equivalents. This may seem a bleak and impoverished vision to those who cherish the inner life. But science, like truth, is not always congenial to our preferences. It demands that we renounce the consolations of plausible conjecture and accept the discipline of verifiable fact. Whether this leaves us with a complete account of man, I shall not presume to say. But it does leave us with a method that is at least free from the taint of metaphysical assumption—and in a subject so riddled with illusion as the human mind, that is no small achievement.\n",

      "In the early 20th century, a significant movement in psychology emerged known as behaviourism, championed most prominently by Professor John B. Watson of Johns Hopkins University. While figures like John Dewey, William James, and F.C.S. Schiller are more typically associated with pragmatism—one of whose founding trios Dewey belonged to—the broader philosophical currents linking empirical observation to knowledge laid groundwork that behaviourism would later radicalize. At its core, behaviourism rests on a strict epistemological principle: scientific knowledge in psychology must be derived solely from what can be externally observed. This position leads behaviourists to reject introspection as a valid method. They do not necessarily deny that internal mental experiences occur, but they insist that such phenomena are inaccessible to objective observation and therefore fall outside the scope of scientific inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, behaviourists argue that psychology should concern itself exclusively with behaviour—defined as observable actions, particularly those involving movement, speech, and response to stimuli. Since internal states like thoughts or feelings cannot be directly measured or verified by others, they are deemed irrelevant to the scientific study of the mind. The only reliable data, according to this view, are behavioural responses that can be recorded, replicated, and analyzed under controlled conditions. Even the possibility that thought accompanies behaviour cannot be confirmed through observation, and thus cannot be considered part of a scientific explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach did not arise from skepticism about human intelligence or from a desire to reduce human complexity. Rather, it was inspired by the study of animal behaviour, where the question of whether non-human animals \"think\" has long stirred debate. Often, people attribute mental states—such as knowing, remembering, or intending—to animals based on their actions, yet without clearly defining what \"thinking\" actually means. Early researchers attempted to infer mental capacities in animals by observing their responses. For instance, a dog coming when called is said to \"know\" its name; a dog displaying excitement upon its owner’s return is believed to \"remember\" them. These emotional and responsive behaviours are indeed observable facts. But the interpretations—that the dog *knows* or *remembers*—are inferences, not data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon closer examination, such inferences begin to unravel. Consider a bird building a nest for the first time. The structure may be perfectly suited for holding eggs, incubation, and raising chicks, but there is no observable evidence that the bird anticipates any of these outcomes. It does not appear to act out of desire, foresight, or intention. Instead, its behaviour is better explained as the result of instinctive impulses shaped by evolution. As Lloyd Morgan argued in his 1912 work *Instinct and Experience*, particularly in Chapter II, instinctive actions do not require prevision; they are triggered by stimuli and carried out without conscious planning. Over time, careful observers of animals have moved away from mentalistic interpretations, choosing instead to describe behaviour in purely mechanistic and observable terms—avoiding assumptions about consciousness or inner experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was this methodological rigor in animal studies that behaviourists proposed should be extended to the study of human beings. If we refrain from attributing thought to animals based on their actions, why should we assume it in humans without equivalent evidence? To illustrate this point, consider a simple example: two children are asked, “What is six times nine?” One answers “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.” Conventionally, we say the first child knows the answer and the second does not. But from a behaviourist standpoint, the only observable difference is the presence or absence of a specific verbal habit. The first child has learned to produce the correct verbal response; the second has not. The correct answer is not proof of thought—it is evidence of a learned association, much like a horse turning into its usual stable when approaching a familiar corner. Both are instances of conditioned behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this light, human knowledge, as it is tested and evaluated—say, in an examination—reduces to a set of observable verbal or behavioural habits. The examiner observes only what the student says or writes, not what (if anything) goes on internally. There is no way to observe the thought process behind a correct answer, nor is there any scientific basis for assuming that thinking occurred at all. Even the most successful examinee might simply be reproducing memorized responses without conscious reflection. From the behaviourist perspective, the examiner has no interest in—and no access to—the inner world of the examinee. What matters is the output: the behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, behaviourism does not deny the existence of internal experience outright, but it insists that such phenomena, if they exist, are beyond the reach of science. The discipline of psychology, to be truly scientific, must restrict itself to what is publicly observable and objectively measurable. As articulated in Watson’s 1914 work *Behavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology*, this method—rooted in the careful study of animals and extended to humans—offers a more rigorous and reliable foundation for understanding behaviour. By replacing vague notions like “thought processes” with precise descriptions of “language habits,” behaviourism aims to transform psychology into a science grounded in evidence, not speculation.\n",

      "There is a school of psychology known as the behaviourists, of which Professor John B. Watson, formerly of Johns Hopkins University, may be regarded as the most representative exponent. John Dewey, though differing in many respects, may be broadly classed with this school, particularly in so far as he shares its distrust of introspection as a source of scientific knowledge. Dewey, along with William James and F.C.S. Schiller, was one of the three founders of pragmatism; but the behaviourist movement, while related in its emphasis on observable consequences, proceeds upon a more radical methodological foundation. Its central thesis is that all knowledge in psychology must be derived from external observation. Introspection—so the argument runs—is not a valid method, because it purports to give access to a private realm inaccessible to others, and therefore incapable of verification. The behaviourist does not necessarily deny that internal mental events occur; what he denies is that such events can be known scientifically. Since they are not open to observation by more than one observer, they cannot enter into the domain of public, verifiable knowledge. Hence, they are excluded from psychology as a science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychology, according to this view, must confine itself exclusively to behaviour—by which is meant what organisms do, not what they are alleged to think or feel. Behaviour is the only datum that can be accurately recorded, measured, and reproduced. The possibility that thought may accompany behaviour is not denied; but such a possibility cannot be established by observation. Indeed, in their investigations of human conduct, behaviourists report that they have found no observable evidence of thought as a distinct process. When people speak, they believe they are thinking; but the behaviourist maintains that speech can be fully accounted for without postulating thought at all. In behaviourist literature, therefore, discussion of “thought processes” is systematically replaced by discussion of “The Language Habit.” This substitution—treating language not as an expression of inner cognition but as a conditioned response—is found to be remarkably effective in explaining the facts of human verbal behaviour. Watson’s *Behavior: an Introduction to Comparative Psychology* (1914) may be cited as a fundamental text in which this standpoint is elaborated with considerable thoroughness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to understand that behaviourism did not arise out of any contempt for human intelligence, nor from a desire to reduce man to the level of a machine. On the contrary, it emerged from patient study of animal behaviour—a field in which the temptation to anthropomorphize has long been strong. The question whether animals “think” has excited popular interest for generations; but those who take sides in the controversy often do so without defining what they mean by thinking. Scientists who wished to approach the matter seriously began to observe animal actions in order to infer the presence or absence of mental processes. At first glance, such inferences may appear justified. A dog comes when called: it is said to “know” its name. It shows signs of sorrow when its master is absent, and exhibits joy—tail-wagging, barking, leaping—upon his return: it is said to “remember” him. These are observable facts. But the interpretation of these facts in mental terms—of “knowing,” “remembering,” and so forth—is an inference, and one that becomes increasingly questionable under scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "As careful observers have accumulated more data, they have found that many complex and apparently purposeful actions in animals can be explained without assuming any foresight or conscious intention. A bird builds its first nest with no prior experience, yet the structure is perfectly adapted to holding eggs, incubation, and rearing young. But there is no evidence that the bird foresees any of these outcomes—that it desires eggs, or anticipates hatching, or imagines the needs of its future offspring. It acts under the impulse of instinct, not under the guidance of purpose. The behaviour is adaptive, but not because it is directed toward an end conceived in advance. As Lloyd Morgan observes in his *Instinct and Experience* (1912, chapter ii), the question whether instinctive actions involve prevision must be met with extreme caution; and the balance of evidence suggests that they do not. The more rigorous the method of observation, the more the tendency has been to describe animal behaviour in purely external terms, avoiding all attribution of consciousness or thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is this method that the behaviourists propose to extend to human beings. If we are to have a scientific psychology, they argue, we must apply the same standards to ourselves that we apply to animals. We must explain human behaviour by reference only to what can be externally observed. To illustrate the principle, though not necessarily the subtlety of the actual doctrine, consider the following simplified case: two children are asked, “What is six times nine?” One answers “fifty-four,” the other “fifty-six.” The first is said to know the answer, the second does not. But what is the observable difference? Simply this: the first child has acquired the habit of uttering the verbal response “fifty-four” when the auditory or visual stimulus “six times nine” is presented; the second has not. The correct answer is not, from the behaviourist standpoint, evidence of thought; it is evidence of a well-formed language habit. The process is comparable to that of a horse turning into its accustomed stable when it reaches a familiar corner: the behaviour is learned, reliable, and appropriate, but there is no need to suppose that the horse forms an image of the stable, or desires it, or thinks about it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with human knowledge as tested in examinations. The examination is an experimental procedure designed to elicit certain observable responses. What is observed is not thought, but behaviour—written or spoken answers. The examiner does not, and cannot, observe the inner processes of the examinee. He has no means of knowing whether the correct answer was accompanied by any mental activity whatever. From the scientific point of view, such activity is irrelevant. The examiner is concerned only with whether the right response occurs. And even the most successful candidate may, for all we can tell, have produced the correct answers automatically, without a moment’s reflection. The behaviourist does not deny that thinking may occur; he merely insists that, since it cannot be observed, it cannot form part of a scientific account of human conduct. His task is to explain behaviour in terms of stimuli and responses, habits and associations—leaving the inner theatre, if it exists, to metaphysicians and poets, but not to psychologists.\n",

      "**TEXT C Analysis (Rank 3):**\n",
      "This text has more noticeable stylistic distance:\n",
      "- Opens with \"In the early 20th century\" - more textbook-like than the ORIGINAL's immediate dive in\n",
      "- Uses more consistently formal academic language: \"epistemological principle,\" \"radicalize\"\n",
      "- The rhythm is more monotonous - lacks the ORIGINAL's variation between longer and shorter movements\n",
      "- Transitions are more mechanical: \"Consequently,\" \"Thus,\" \"In this light\"\n",
      "- Less personality in the voice - feels more like an encyclopedia entry\n",
      "- The concrete examples are present but introduced more stiffly\n",

      "**TEXT B Analysis (Rank 4):**\n",
      "This text departs most significantly from the ORIGINAL's style:\n",
      "- Opens with elaborate, ornate phrasing: \"It is a curious and not altogether encouraging circumstance that the progress of science should so often require the dismantling of what appears, to the untrained mind, self-evident\"\n",
      "- This is far more Victorian/elaborate than the ORIGINAL's direct opening\n",
      "- Consistently uses more complex sentence structures with multiple subordinate clauses\n",
      "- Vocabulary is noticeably more elevated: \"seductive,\" \"gratuitous,\" \"metaphysical assumption\"\n",
      "- Has a more self-consciously literary quality: \"behind the veil of privacy,\" \"invisible and unobservable inner drama\"\n",
      "- The rhythm is more rhetorical and less conversational\n",
      "- While intelligent and well-written, it represents a different authorial persona - more formal, more distanced\n",
      "- The closing philosophical meditation (\"Whether this leaves us with a complete account of man, I shall not presume to say\") is more grandiloquent than anything in the ORIGINAL\n",
      "\n",
      "The key discriminator is that TEXT D maintains the ORIGINAL's balance of accessibility and intellectual seriousness, its natural rhythm, and its occasional dry humor, while TEXT B adopts a more elevated register throughout, TEXT C becomes more textbook-like, and TEXT A, though close, is slightly more explicitly didactic.\n"
