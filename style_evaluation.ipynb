    "# Style Instruction Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how well derived style instructions enable style replication, compared to alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text:\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different methods (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Generic baseline\n",
    "   - Few-shot learning\n",
    "   - Author name prompting\n",
    "   - Derived style instructions\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions from 1-4 based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D) - no method names\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 2 = second, 3 = third, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples to eliminate bias\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which method best captures style\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "   a. Origin: the gregarious instinct—co-operation within the in-group, hostility to out-groups.  \n",
      "   b. Function: to label the goals of the in-group “good” and those of outsiders “wicked,” thereby disguising self-interest as universal justice.  \n",

      "\n",
      "3. Consequence for philosophy  \n",
      "   – Using ethics as a key to reality is “pre-Copernican”: it places present human wishes at the centre and legislates for the universe.  \n",
      "   – Such ethics blocks receptivity to fact and prevents the “imaginative liberation from self” that science demands.  \n",
      "   – Every ethical metaphysics is therefore parochial, time-bound, and scientifically unreliable.\n",
