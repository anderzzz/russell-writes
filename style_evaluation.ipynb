    "# Style Instruction Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how well derived style instructions enable style replication, compared to alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text:\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different methods (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Generic baseline\n",
    "   - Few-shot learning\n",
    "   - Author name prompting\n",
    "   - Derived style instructions\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions from 1-4 based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D) - no method names\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 2 = second, 3 = third, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples to eliminate bias\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which method best captures style\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "\n",
      "Dr. Arnold’s system, which has remained in force in English public\n",

      "possessing the merits and defects of the Spartans. But aristocracy\n",
      "is out-of-date, and subject populations will no longer obey even the\n",
      "most wise and virtuous rulers. The rulers are driven into brutality,\n",
      "and brutality further encourages revolt. The complexity of the modern\n",

      "and more belief in technical knowledge. The administrator of the\n",
      "future must be the servant of free citizens, not the benevolent ruler\n",
      "of admiring subjects. The aristocratic tradition embedded in British\n",
      "higher education is its bane. Perhaps this tradition can be eliminated\n",

      "praise is due to those who accomplish it. But America, like Japan, is\n",
      "placed in a peculiar situation, and what the special circumstances\n",
      "justify is not necessarily an ideal to be followed everywhere and\n",
      "always. America has had certain advantages and certain difficulties.\n",
      "Among the advantages were: a higher standard of wealth; freedom from\n",
      "the danger of defeat in war; comparative absence of cramping traditions\n",
      "inherited from the Middle Ages. Immigrants found in America a generally\n",
      "diffused sentiment of democracy and an advanced stage of industrial\n",

      "America: his inner freedom is greater even where his political freedom\n",
      "is less. In these respects, the American public schools do harm. The\n",
      "harm is essential to the teaching of an exclusive American patriotism.\n",
      "The harm, as with the Japanese and the Jesuits, comes from regarding\n",
      "the pupils as means to an end, not as ends in themselves. The teacher\n",
      "should love his children better than his State or his Church; otherwise\n",
      "he is not an ideal teacher.\n",

      "effects of human actions are so uncertain that a wise man will tend to\n",
      "dismiss them from his calculations. Broadly speaking, good men have\n",

      "invariable law of nature. A bad man may murder a tyrant because he has\n",
      "committed crimes which the tyrant intends to punish; the effects of\n",
      "his act may be good, though he and his act are bad. Nevertheless, as a\n",
      "broad general rule, a community of men and women who are intrinsically\n",
      "excellent will have better effects than one composed of people who are\n",
      "ignorant and malevolent. Apart from such considerations, children\n",

      "material for some scheme. Neither character nor intelligence will\n",
      "develop as well or as freely where the teacher is deficient in love;\n",

      "- The Jesuits structured their educational system to serve the interests of the Catholic Church rather than the individual development of students. Their primary aim was not the well-being of the pupil but the advancement of the Church’s goals.  \n",
      "- From the perspective of Catholic theology, this approach is defensible, as saving souls from eternal damnation is considered a higher priority than any earthly concern, and the Church is seen as the sole means to achieve salvation.  \n",
      "- However, for those who do not accept this theological framework, the evaluation of Jesuit education must be based on its outcomes.  \n",
      "- One unintended outcome was the emergence of figures like Voltaire, who was educated under Jesuit methods but became a critic of religion and authority.  \n",
      "- Despite such exceptions, the Jesuits were largely successful in achieving their intended goals: the Counter-Reformation and the decline of Protestantism in France are attributed significantly to their efforts.  \n",
      "- To achieve these results, the Jesuits promoted sentimental art, superficial thought, and morally lax behavior. The long-term consequences of these educational practices contributed to societal decay, requiring the French Revolution to eliminate the damage.  \n",
      "- The central flaw in Jesuit education was that it was motivated not by care for the student but by external objectives. The students were treated as instruments rather than as individuals with intrinsic value.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Dr. Arnold's educational system, implemented in English public schools and enduring to the present, had a different flaw: it was fundamentally aristocratic in purpose.  \n",
      "- The goal was to prepare students for leadership and authority, both domestically and across the British Empire.  \n",
      "- An enduring aristocracy requires specific virtues—energy, stoicism, physical fitness, unwavering beliefs, high moral standards, and a belief in a global mission—and these were cultivated in schools.  \n",
      "- These aims were largely achieved. However, this came at the cost of suppressing intellect, as intellectual inquiry could lead to doubt.  \n",
      "- Sympathy was suppressed because it might interfere with ruling over subordinate races or classes. Kindness was sacrificed for toughness; imagination for firmness.  \n",
      "- In a static society, such a system might have produced a stable ruling class similar to the Spartans, with both strengths and limitations.  \n",
      "- However, aristocracy is no longer viable in the modern world. Subject populations no longer accept even well-intentioned rule by elites.  \n",
      "- When rulers lose legitimacy, they resort to brutality, which in turn fuels resistance and rebellion.  \n",
      "- The complexity of contemporary problems demands intelligence, which Dr. Arnold’s system explicitly subordinated to moral and character-based ideals.  \n",
      "- While it may be true that the Battle of Waterloo was \"won on the playing fields of Eton,\" the same system is contributing to the decline of the British Empire.  \n",
      "- The modern world requires a different kind of person: one with greater imaginative empathy, intellectual flexibility, less reliance on traditional courage, and more emphasis on technical competence.  \n",
      "- Future administrators must serve free citizens rather than govern subjects.  \n",
      "- The persistence of aristocratic values in British higher education is a major obstacle.  \n",
      "- It is uncertain whether these institutions can reform themselves gradually or whether they are structurally incapable of change. No conclusion is offered on this point.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- American public schools have succeeded in a historically unprecedented task: turning a diverse population into a unified national identity.  \n",
      "- This achievement is considered largely positive, and those responsible deserve significant credit.  \n",
      "- However, the American context is unique, and what works under these conditions may not be suitable as a universal model.  \n",
      "- America had certain advantages: higher wealth, absence of major war threats, and limited medieval traditions.  \n",
      "- Immigrants encountered widespread democratic ideals and advanced industrial technology, which were major reasons for their admiration of America.  \n",
      "- Immigrants themselves usually maintain dual loyalties: they support America but remain emotionally attached to their countries of origin, especially in times of European conflict.  \n",
      "- Their children, however, typically lose all connection to their ancestral nations and become fully American.  \n",
      "- This shift is primarily due to school education. The role of schools in this transformation is the focus of analysis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- When American schools teach patriotism based on the country's real strengths, there is no need to promote false values.  \n",
      "- However, in areas where the Old World surpasses the New, schools must instill contempt for genuine excellence to maintain exclusive patriotism.  \n",
      "- Western Europe generally has a higher intellectual standard than America. Eastern Europe has a higher artistic standard.  \n",
      "- Most of Western Europe, except Spain and Portugal, exhibits less theological superstition than America.  \n",
      "- In nearly all European countries, individuals enjoy greater personal freedom from social pressure than in America, even when political freedoms are more limited.  \n",
      "- In these respects, American public schools cause harm by denigrating superior achievements elsewhere.  \n",
      "- This harm is inherent in treating students as tools for national unity rather than as individuals with their own ends.  \n",
      "- A teacher should value students more than the state or the church. A teacher who does not is not ideal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- The principle that students should be treated as ends in themselves, not as means, may be challenged by the argument that a person’s value as a means (through their lasting impact) exceeds their value as an end (their personal experience, which ends at death).  \n",
      "- This claim cannot be denied: the consequences of actions can persist indefinitely.  \n",
      "- However, the moral implications drawn from this claim can be rejected. The long-term effects of human actions are highly unpredictable, so a rational person should not base decisions primarily on distant outcomes.  \n",
      "- Generally, good people tend to produce good effects, and bad people tend to produce bad effects, though this is not a strict rule.  \n",
      "- For example, a bad person might kill a tyrant for selfish reasons, resulting in a positive outcome despite the moral defect of the actor and the act.  \n",
      "- Nonetheless, as a broad principle, a society composed of morally and intellectually excellent individuals will produce better results than one made up of ignorant and hostile people.  \n",
      "- Additionally, children and young people can sense whether adults truly care for them or see them merely as material for a larger project.  \n",
      "- Character and intelligence develop less effectively in environments where teachers lack genuine care.  \n",
      "- This kind of care consists fundamentally in perceiving the child as an end in themselves.  \n",
      "- People naturally desire good things for themselves without needing to justify these desires in terms of broader goals.  \n",
      "- Affectionate parents have the same attitude toward their children: they want their children to grow, be healthy, succeed in school, etc., in the same way they want things for themselves. This does not require moral sacrifice or abstract reasoning.  \n",
      "- This parental instinct can extend beyond one's own children. In its broader form, it is essential for anyone who is to be a good teacher of young children.  \n",
      "- This feeling becomes less central as students age, but those who lack it should not be trusted to design educational systems.  \n",
      "- Individuals who believe that male education should produce men willing to kill and die for trivial reasons lack this broader parental concern.  \n",
      "- Such individuals currently control education systems in nearly all civilized countries, with the exception of Denmark and China.\n"

      "\n",
      "It is a curious feature of human institutions that they so often present themselves as benevolent while being, in truth, instruments of ulterior design. The Jesuits, for example, constructed an educational system of remarkable efficiency and discipline, which in its day was widely admired for its rigor and coherence. Yet it would be a profound mistake to suppose that its primary object was the development of the individual pupil. No: the Jesuit school was not a garden for the cultivation of minds, but a workshop for the forging of tools. The student was not regarded as an end in himself, but as a means to the greater glory of the Church, the salvation of souls, and the defeat of heresy. From the standpoint of Catholic theology, this is not without justification. If eternal damnation is a real possibility, and if the Church is indeed the sole vessel of salvation, then all earthly considerations—freedom of thought, personal growth, intellectual adventure—must yield before the imperative of rescue from infinite peril. Within that framework, the suppression of doubt, the promotion of sentimentality, the cultivation of moral laxity in the interest of outward conformity—all become defensible, even laudable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for those of us who do not accept the dogmatic premises of Counter-Reformation theology, judgment must rest upon consequences. And when we examine the outcomes of Jesuit education, we find a curious paradox. The system, despite its dogmatic aims, did succeed in many of its practical intentions: it played a decisive role in rolling back Protestantism in France, and in reinforcing the temporal power of the Church during the Counter-Reformation. Yet it also produced, almost by accident, the very spirit it sought to suppress. Voltaire, that scourge of priestcraft and superstition, was himself a product of Jesuit teaching. His keen mind, sharpened by the very logic his instructors had hoped to channel into orthodoxy, turned instead upon the foundations of their authority. This is a common fate of repressive systems: they may succeed, but at the cost of creating their own most effective adversaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, exceptions of this kind do not absolve the system. The broader effect of Jesuit education was to foster a culture of emotionalism, shallow reasoning, and moral double standards—qualities that, over time, contributed to the decay of French society. The spiritual and intellectual stagnation they encouraged could not be indefinitely sustained; the French Revolution, in all its violence and excess, was in part the necessary purge of a system that had long treated human beings as pawns rather than persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar flaw, though of a different kind, marks the educational philosophy of Dr. Arnold as it took root in the English public schools and spread throughout the institutions of the British elite. Arnold’s aim was not to liberate the mind, but to form a ruling class—stoical, energetic, physically robust, morally upright, and imbued with a sense of imperial mission. These were not ideals of enlightenment, but of discipline and command. The virtues promoted were precisely those required to govern a vast and diverse empire: resoluteness, self-control, confidence in one’s own righteousness, and a capacity to endure hardship without complaint. And in this, the system was largely successful. It produced administrators and soldiers who could maintain order across continents, and who believed, with unshakable conviction, that they were serving a higher cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "But such success was purchased at a steep price. Intellectual curiosity was discouraged, for it breeds doubt; sympathy was regarded as weakness, since it might interfere with the firm rule of “lesser” races; imagination was suspect, kindness softening. The ideal was not the philosopher, but the officer; not the thinker, but the man of action. In a static, hierarchical world, such a system might have endured, producing a kind of modern Sparta—efficient, austere, and coherent. But the modern world is not static. Subject peoples no longer accept the benevolence of foreign domination, however well-intentioned. When legitimacy fades, rule becomes mere force, and force breeds resistance. Moreover, the problems of our age—economic, scientific, diplomatic—are of a complexity that demands intelligence, flexibility, and understanding, not merely courage and conviction. It may be true, as the old saying has it, that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton; but it is equally true that the decline of the British Empire is being accelerated by the very same educational ideals. The modern administrator must not command subjects, but serve citizens—free, critical, and diverse. And for this task, the Arnoldian model is ill-suited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The persistence of aristocratic values in British higher education is thus not merely an anachronism; it is a danger. Whether the institutions themselves can undergo gradual reform, or whether they are so deeply structured by their past purposes as to be incapable of genuine change—this is a question I do not presume to answer. But the need for change is evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "In America, a different experiment has unfolded—one of astonishing success in its own terms. The public school system has achieved what few nations have even attempted: the transformation of a vast, heterogeneous population of immigrants into a unified national community. This is no small feat, and those responsible deserve no small measure of credit. The United States, blessed with wealth, peace, and freedom from the stifling weight of medieval institutions, offered immigrants not only economic opportunity but a vision of democratic equality and technological progress. These were powerful magnets, and the schools became the primary means of assimilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the process is not without its moral cost. The child of immigrants typically loses all attachment to the old country, embracing instead a thoroughly American identity. This transformation is largely the work of the schools. And herein lies the difficulty: while patriotism based on genuine national strengths is both reasonable and admirable, patriotism that must be maintained in the face of foreign superiority requires the suppression of truth. For it is undeniable that in many respects, the Old World surpasses the New. Western Europe, with the exception of Spain and Portugal, is intellectually more vigorous and less burdened by theological superstition. Eastern Europe produces art of greater depth and originality. In nearly every European country, the individual enjoys more personal freedom from the tyranny of public opinion than in the United States—though often at the cost of fewer political liberties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet American schools, in their zeal for national unity, often inculcate contempt for these very excellences. They teach children to scorn what is better, simply because it is foreign. In doing so, they repeat the ancient error: they treat students not as ends in themselves, but as raw material for the construction of a nation-state. And this, fundamentally, is the flaw that runs through so many systems of education. The teacher, if he is to be worthy of the name, must care for the child more than for the state, more than for the church, more than for any abstract cause. He must see the child not as a future soldier, priest, or patriot, but as a human being with a life to live, a mind to grow, and a soul—however we choose to define it—that deserves respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may object that this view underestimates the importance of consequences. After all, a person’s value as a means—through the lasting effects of his actions—may far exceed his value as an end, since personal experience ceases at death, while influence may endure for centuries. This is undeniable. The ripple effects of human deeds extend far beyond the grave. But the practical inference—that we should therefore treat individuals as instruments for distant futures—is profoundly unsound. The future is inherently unpredictable; no one can calculate with certainty what long-term consequences will follow from any given action. What we can know, however, is that societies composed of wise, humane, and intelligent people tend to produce better outcomes than those composed of bigots, fanatics, or fools. Moreover, children are acutely sensitive to whether they are genuinely loved or merely used. They flourish best under care that is disinterested, that desires their good for its own sake, not as a step toward some ulterior end.\n",
      "\n",
      "This attitude is not rare; it is the natural extension of parental affection. A parent wishes his child to be healthy, to learn, to succeed—not because of what the child will achieve for society, but because the child is dear to him. This feeling, when extended beyond one’s own offspring, is the foundation of true education. It diminishes somewhat as students grow older, but its absence in those who design systems of instruction is a fatal defect. For it is precisely those who lack this instinct who imagine that the purpose of male education is to produce men willing to kill and die for causes of trivial importance. Such men now preside over the education of youth in nearly every civilized country—save, perhaps, Denmark and China. And until this changes, education will remain not a liberation, but a form of servitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FEWSHOT\n",
      "===================\n",
      "\n",
      "The educational system of the Jesuits was never designed with the well-being of the individual pupil as its aim; it was conceived, from the outset, as an instrument of the Catholic Church, and shaped entirely to serve ecclesiastical ends. The development of character, the cultivation of reason, the expansion of personal capacity—these were not the primary objects. What mattered was the production of loyal agents, defenders of the faith, soldiers in the spiritual warfare against heresy and unbelief. From the standpoint of Catholic theology, such an arrangement is entirely defensible. If the soul is in danger of eternal damnation, and if the Church alone holds the keys to salvation, then no earthly interest—least of all the transient happiness or intellectual curiosity of a child—can claim equal weight. The salvation of souls, in this view, justifies every method, however severe or manipulative, that tends to secure allegiance to the Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for those who do not accept this theological framework, the value of the Jesuit system cannot be measured by its internal consistency or doctrinal purity; it must be judged by its actual consequences. And here, the record is mixed. There were, to be sure, unintended outcomes. Among the most conspicuous of these was the emergence of minds like that of Voltaire, who passed through the Jesuit schools, absorbed their discipline, mastered their rhetoric, and then turned with devastating effect against the very institutions that had formed him. Yet such cases were rare exceptions. On the whole, the Jesuits achieved their intended purpose with remarkable success. The Counter-Reformation in France, the re-Catholicization of large sections of the population, the arrest and reversal of Protestant growth—these were accomplishments in which the educational labours of the Society of Jesus played a central role.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the price paid for this success was high. To maintain emotional loyalty and suppress critical inquiry, the Jesuits fostered a culture of sentimental piety, cultivated superficial modes of thought, and encouraged moral laxity where it served ecclesiastical convenience. They taught reverence for authority, not truth; obedience, not understanding. The result, over time, was not merely intellectual stagnation, but a deep-seated corruption of moral and civic life. A society trained to value ceremony over substance, conformity over conscience, became incapable of genuine reform from within. It required the violent convulsion of the French Revolution to sweep away the accumulated debris of centuries—an upheaval that destroyed much that was good along with the bad, but without which, perhaps, no renewal could have been possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the root of this failure was a fundamental error: the student was not regarded as an end in himself, but as a means to an end. He was to be shaped, not for his own sake, but for the sake of the Church’s mission. His individuality was to be subordinated, his natural curiosity disciplined into submission, his affections directed toward institutional loyalty rather than personal growth. The flaw was not in the rigour of the instruction, nor in the dedication of the teachers, but in the very principle upon which the whole system rested.\n",
      "\n",
      "In England, a different educational ideal arose—one no less instrumental, though serving a different master. The system established by Dr. Arnold in the great public schools was aristocratic in aim and spirit. Its purpose was not to develop individuals, but to produce a ruling class: men fitted to govern at home and to command across the vast expanse of the British Empire. Such a class, if it is to endure, must possess certain qualities—energy, stoicism, physical robustness, moral certainty, a sense of duty, and above all, a belief in the righteousness of its mission. These were the virtues instilled in the schoolboy at Rugby, Eton, Harrow. And the system succeeded. It produced generations of administrators, soldiers, and statesmen who carried the British flag to every continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this success came at a cost. Intellect was suspect, for intellectual inquiry leads to doubt, and doubt undermines authority. Sympathy was dangerous, because to feel too deeply the sufferings of subject races or oppressed classes might weaken the will to rule. Kindness was sacrificed to toughness, imagination to firmness, nuance to decisiveness. In a stable, hierarchical society, such a system might have endured indefinitely, producing a kind of modern Sparta—respected, feared, but inwardly rigid and culturally barren. But the modern world is not static. The subjects of empire no longer accept the rule of foreign elites, however well-intentioned. When legitimacy fades, rule can be maintained only by force; and force, in turn, breeds resistance, rebellion, and eventual collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the problems of the contemporary age—economic, scientific, social—are of such complexity that they cannot be solved by character alone. They demand intelligence, flexibility, foresight—qualities that Arnold’s system deliberately suppressed. It may be true, as the old saying has it, that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton; but it is equally true that the decline of the British Empire is being accelerated by the same educational ideals. The world now requires a different kind of man: one who is not merely courageous and resolute, but also imaginative, empathetic, technically competent, and capable of governing not subjects, but free citizens. The persistence of aristocratic values in British higher education is thus not a strength, but a profound obstacle to national adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether these institutions can reform themselves from within, or whether their structure is too deeply entrenched to permit genuine change, is a question to which no answer can be confidently given. They may, like the Jesuit schools before them, cling to a dying ideal until history sweeps them aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "In America, a different experiment has been carried out—one unprecedented in human history. The public school system has succeeded in transforming a vast and heterogeneous population, drawn from every corner of the globe, into a single national community. This is no small achievement. The forces of division—language, religion, custom, tradition—were immense. That they have been overcome, to the extent they have, is due in large measure to the schools. And for this, those who built and maintained the system deserve considerable credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the American case is not a universal model. The conditions under which this unification occurred were exceptionally favourable: great wealth, the absence of major external threats, a relatively light burden of medieval institutions, and a society already permeated by democratic ideals and industrial progress. Immigrants came to a land where machines and factories pointed to the future, and where equality—however imperfect in practice—was at least proclaimed as an ideal. They admired America not because it was perfect, but because it seemed to offer a chance of something better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the process of assimilation is incomplete in the first generation. Most immigrants retain a dual loyalty: they support their new country, but they weep when their old lands go to war. It is their children who become fully American—children whose minds are shaped almost entirely by the schools. The school, therefore, is the true crucible of national identity in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, too, a danger arises. When patriotism is based on genuine national strengths—on liberty, on opportunity, on material progress—there is no need for deception. But in those areas where the Old World surpasses the New, the school must either acknowledge the superiority of others or undermine it. And too often, it chooses the latter. Western Europe, with the exception of Spain and Portugal, is intellectually more advanced than America. Eastern Europe has produced a higher standard of artistic achievement. In nearly every European country, the individual enjoys greater personal freedom from social pressure than in the United States, even when political liberty is more constrained. Theological superstition is less widespread in most of Western Europe than in large parts of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "To preserve an exclusive and uncritical patriotism, American schools must therefore teach contempt for these real excellences. They must denigrate foreign cultures, belittle intellectual pursuits, and glorify mediocrity under the name of democracy. In doing so, they repeat the old error: they treat the student not as an end in himself, but as raw material for the construction of national unity. And in this, they betray the true function of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "One may object that a person’s value lies not in his own experience, which ends at death, but in the consequences of his actions, which may endure indefinitely. And this is true: the effects of human deeds ripple outward through time in ways we cannot foresee. A bad man may, by accident, do good; a good man may, through error, cause great harm. Yet this does not mean that we should disregard the moral character of individuals in favour of distant and uncertain outcomes. The long-term consequences of human action are, by their nature, unpredictable. A rational being cannot govern his choices by speculations about effects that may emerge centuries later.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we can know, and what we should value, is that good people, on the whole, produce good results, and bad people, on the whole, produce bad ones. A society composed of intelligent, humane, and thoughtful individuals is more likely to prosper than one made up of fanatics, fools, or tyrants. But such a society cannot be created by systems that treat children as instruments. For children, no less than adults, can detect whether they are truly cared for or merely used. Character and intelligence flourish only where there is genuine affection, where the adult sees in the child not a future soldier, priest, or administrator, but a human being with his own ends, his own possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the parental instinct: the desire for another’s good, not because of what he may become, but because of what he is. A mother wants her child to be healthy, to learn, to grow—not because he will one day serve the state, but because he is hers, and because his well-being matters to her as her own. This sentiment, when extended beyond blood ties, becomes the foundation of all true education. It is this feeling\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERIC\n",
      "===================\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout history, educational systems have often been shaped less by the needs of the students they serve and more by the agendas of the institutions that sustain them. The Jesuits, for instance, designed their schools not as spaces for individual growth but as instruments of the Catholic Church’s spiritual mission. Their ultimate objective was not personal flourishing but the salvation of souls—understood within their theological framework as the highest possible good. From this vantage point, the subordination of the pupil to ecclesiastical aims was not only justified but imperative, for if eternal damnation were real and the Church the sole conduit to salvation, then any means necessary to secure adherence seemed morally defensible. Yet for those who do not share this metaphysical foundation, the legitimacy of such education must be judged by its consequences. And while the Jesuits succeeded remarkably in their aims—playing a decisive role in the Counter-Reformation and the re-Catholicization of France—their methods carried deep and lasting costs. They cultivated a culture of emotional religiosity, intellectual passivity, and moral convenience, which, over time, eroded the vitality of French society. The very art and sentimentality they promoted bred a superficiality that left the nation unprepared for rational self-governance, ultimately requiring the violent rupture of the French Revolution to dismantle the rot they had helped entrench. The root of the problem lay in their foundational premise: students were not valued for themselves, but as vessels for doctrine, as tools for institutional survival.\n",

      "A similar instrumentalism, though of a different kind, characterized the educational reforms of Dr. Arnold in 19th-century England. His vision, implemented across the elite public schools, was aristocratic in both purpose and effect. The goal was not to cultivate self-realized individuals, but to forge a ruling class—men of energy, stoicism, physical vigor, and unwavering moral conviction—capable of administering the vast British Empire. These were men who believed in their mission to civilize, to rule, and to endure. And in this, the system succeeded: it produced generations of leaders who carried the empire forward with a sense of duty and fortitude. But success came at a steep price. Intellectual curiosity was discouraged, for questioning could lead to doubt, and doubt to weakness. Sympathy was muted, lest compassion interfere with the firm hand needed to govern subject peoples. Kindness was sacrificed for toughness, imagination for resolve. In a static, hierarchical world, such a system might have endured, producing a stable, if rigid, elite—akin to the Spartans, admired for their discipline but limited by their insularity. But the modern world is neither static nor hierarchical in the old sense. The subjects of empire no longer accept even the most well-meaning domination, and when legitimacy fades, authority resorts to force, which only fuels resistance. Moreover, today’s challenges—economic complexity, technological change, global interdependence—demand intelligence, adaptability, and empathy, qualities that Dr. Arnold’s system systematically suppressed. While it may be true, as the old saying goes, that “the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton,” it is equally plausible that the decline of the British Empire was accelerated by the same educational ethos. The world now calls for a different kind of leader: one who serves citizens, not subjects; who values technical competence over traditional courage; who leads with imaginative empathy rather than unquestioned authority. Yet the persistence of aristocratic ideals in British higher education continues to obstruct this transformation. Whether these institutions can reform themselves from within, or whether they are too structurally bound to their past to evolve, remains an open question.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, American public schools have achieved something remarkable: the forging of a unified national identity from a vast, diverse population of immigrants. This is no small feat, and those who built and sustained this system deserve considerable credit. The United States benefited from unique advantages—abundant wealth, the absence of devastating wars on its soil, and a relative lack of feudal or medieval constraints—that made such integration more feasible. Newcomers arrived to find not only opportunity but also a culture saturated with democratic ideals and industrial progress, both of which inspired admiration and loyalty. Still, the process of Americanization was not automatic. Immigrants themselves often retained dual loyalties—pledging allegiance to their new country while preserving emotional ties to their homelands, especially during times of upheaval in Europe. It was their children, however, who became fully American, and this transformation was driven above all by the public school system. Schools became the crucible in which a new identity was forged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet this success has a darker side. When American schools teach patriotism rooted in genuine national strengths—innovation, freedom, opportunity—there is little cause for concern. But where the Old World surpasses the New, schools often resort to denigration. Western Europe, for example, maintains a higher intellectual standard; Eastern Europe, a richer artistic tradition. Most of Western Europe, excluding only Spain and Portugal, is less burdened by theological dogma than much of the United States. And in nearly every European country, individuals enjoy greater personal freedom from social conformity, even when political liberties are curtailed. By dismissing or belittling these achievements, American education risks instilling not pride, but provincialism. The harm lies not merely in misinformation, but in the underlying philosophy: students are treated not as individuals with their own potential and perspectives, but as raw material to be shaped into loyal citizens. When education serves the state above the child, it sacrifices truth and individuality on the altar of unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This raises a deeper ethical question: should students be treated as ends in themselves, or as means to some larger social goal? One might argue that a person’s value as a means—through the enduring consequences of their actions—outweighs their value as an end, since personal experience ends at death, while effects can ripple through generations. There is truth in this: history is shaped by consequences, and some of the most lasting impacts have come from individuals whose motives were far from pure. A tyrant might be killed by a selfish assassin, and though the act is morally flawed, the outcome may still be good. Yet this does not mean we should design education around such unpredictable outcomes. The long-term effects of human actions are inherently uncertain; no one can foresee how a life will reverberate through time. What we can know is that societies composed of thoughtful, ethical, and intelligent people tend to produce better results than those built on ignorance and hostility. Moreover, children are remarkably perceptive: they can sense when adults truly care for them and when they are being used. Character and intellect flourish most in environments where care is genuine, where the child is seen not as a tool but as a person with intrinsic worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This caring is not a moral abstraction; it is a natural extension of the parental instinct. Parents want their children to grow, to be healthy, to succeed—not because of some distant utilitarian calculation, but because they love them. This desire requires no justification; it is as immediate as the desire for one’s own well-being. And this same affectionate concern can and should extend beyond blood relations. It is, in fact, the foundation of good teaching, especially in the early years. While such nurturing may become less central as students mature, those who lack it should never be entrusted with shaping educational systems. For those who believe that education’s highest purpose is to produce men willing to kill and die for trivial causes—those who see youth as cannon fodder for ideology—clearly do not value children as ends in themselves. And tragically, such individuals currently dominate educational leadership in nearly every so-called civilized nation. Only in a few places—Denmark and China among them—does a different ethos appear to hold sway. Whether the rest can awaken to a more humane vision remains to be seen.\n",

      "The table stands in the room.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is not a metaphor. It is wood and nails, varnish and grain, legs planted firmly on the floor. We can touch it, see its shadow, move it from one corner to another. The table is real. When we speak of education, we must begin with something just as real: the child in the schoolroom. That child is not an abstraction. He breathes, grows, feels fear and joy, wants to be known. He is not a means. He is an end.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let us take in illustration the Jesuits. In this case, we must consider their educational system not as a collection of classrooms and curricula, but as a mechanism designed for a purpose. That purpose was not the flourishing of the boy, but the survival and expansion of the Church. The boy was to be shaped, disciplined, directed—not for his sake, but for the salvation of souls. And, from the standpoint of Catholic theology, this may be admitted as reasonable: if eternal damnation is real, then no earthly cost is too great to avoid it. The Church, on this view, is not one institution among others; it is the only vessel capable of carrying men across the abyss.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It may be said that such a system, however severe, serves a higher truth. And indeed, it must be granted that the Jesuits were effective. The Counter-Reformation gained much of its momentum from their schools. Protestantism receded in France not by arms alone, but by sermons, rituals, and the daily discipline of youth. They taught prayer with passion, liturgy with beauty, obedience with firmness. They won battles not on fields, but in minds.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But none of this ever brought us to the student himself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For those who do not accept the theological premise, the question must be: what kind of human being does this system produce? And here, the evidence is mixed. Voltaire sat in a Jesuit classroom. He learned Latin, rhetoric, theology. He emerged not as a defender of the faith, but as its most devastating critic. His mind, sharpened by their methods, turned against them. This was not the intended outcome. Yet it was real.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We must therefore return to the structure of their method. The Jesuits cultivated sentiment—piety expressed in tears, in music, in dramatic processions. They favored the appearance of virtue over the habits of reflection. They taught submission, not inquiry. And where thought threatened faith, thought was discouraged. Moral laxity in authority was tolerated, so long as the forms were preserved. The long-term result was not holiness, but hypocrisy. Not strength, but decay.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And when decay sets in, revolution follows. The French Revolution did not arise from nothing. It was, in part, the correction of a system that had treated people as instruments. The table in the room—the real, solid table—had been ignored for too long.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now take another case: Dr. Arnold’s system at Rugby. Here, the end was not salvation, but empire. The boy was to become a ruler—not of souls, but of men: in India, in Africa, in the colonies of the far world. He was to be energetic, disciplined, physically strong. He was to believe without doubt in his mission, in his race, in his God. He was to endure hardship, to suppress fear, to command.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It may be said that such virtues are necessary for empire. And it must be admitted that they were cultivated with success. The British Empire did not fall from weakness of will. It stood for a century on the backs of men trained to rule. They were stoic. They were resolute. They believed in duty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But none of this ever brought us to the student himself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For such a system, intellect was dangerous. Doubt was a disease. Sympathy for the ruled was a flaw. Kindness might interfere with authority. Imagination might lead to hesitation. So these were suppressed. Energy was valued more than understanding. Loyalty more than truth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In a static world, this might have worked. Sparta had its virtues. But the modern world is not Sparta. Subject peoples no longer accept the rule of elites, however well-intentioned. When legitimacy fades, power turns to brutality. And brutality provokes rebellion.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the problems of our time are not solved by courage alone. They require intelligence. They require flexibility. They require a mind that can learn from others, not merely command them. The Battle of Waterloo may have been won on the playing fields of Eton. But the peace of the world will not be kept there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The British Empire is in decline. And part of the reason is that its schools still teach the old virtues, while the world demands new ones. The administrator of tomorrow must serve free citizens, not govern subjects. He must understand, not dominate. He must be technically competent, not merely morally upright.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And yet the old values persist. The public schools still honor the same ideals. It is uncertain whether they can reform themselves. It may be that their structure is too deeply aristocratic, too committed to hierarchy, to allow genuine change. No conclusion can be drawn. But the question must be faced.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now turn to America. In this case, the achievement is unique. A nation composed of every race, every language, every creed—yet unified in identity. This did not happen by accident. It happened in the schools. Immigrants arrived with loyalty divided. They loved their new land, but remembered the old. Their children do not remember. They are American. Fully. Entirely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This transformation is due, in large part, to education. The schools taught patriotism. They taught history. They taught the Constitution. And in many ways, this is good. The unity of a diverse people is a rare and valuable thing. Those who built this system deserve credit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But let us consider the method. When America surpasses others—when its industry, its wealth, its freedom are greater—then patriotism can be honest. It can point to real excellence. But where the Old World is superior, a problem arises.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Western Europe has, on the whole, a higher intellectual standard. Eastern Europe, a deeper artistic tradition. Most of Western Europe—except Spain and Portugal—is less burdened by theological superstition. In nearly every European country, the individual enjoys greater freedom from social pressure, even where political freedom is less.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet American schools cannot acknowledge this. For if they do, then patriotism becomes conditional. So they teach contempt for what is better elsewhere. They denigrate European thought, art, liberty. They present America as superior in all things.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And here again, the student is not an end. He is a tool. His mind is shaped not to see the world as it is, but to serve a national myth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It may be argued that the value of a person lies not in their experience, but in their consequences. A man dies, but his actions may echo for centuries. A teacher may shape a leader whose policies affect millions. In this sense, the means may outlast the end.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It must be admitted that this is true. The consequences of human action are often vast and enduring. A law may last a hundred years. A discovery may change the world.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But such effects are unpredictable. A wise man does not act for distant outcomes he cannot foresee. He acts for what he can know: the good before him, the person in front of him.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And as a rule, good people produce good results. Bad people produce harm. There are exceptions—a tyrant killed by a selfish man, for instance. But on the whole, a society of intelligent, moral people will do better than one of fools and fanatics.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, children know when they are loved. They sense whether a teacher sees them as a person or as material. Character does not grow in soil where care is absent. Intelligence does not flourish where the mind is treated as a weapon, not a wonder.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To care for a child is not a moral duty in the abstract. It is a natural impulse. Parents want their children to be healthy, happy, strong—not because it serves a cause, but because they love them. They want it as they want things for themselves.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This feeling can extend beyond blood. A teacher may feel it for students. A doctor for patients. A leader for citizens. When it is present, education becomes possible. When it is absent, education becomes manipulation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And those who design systems should be guided by this feeling. If a man believes that education’s highest goal is to produce men willing to kill and die for trivial reasons, then he does not have it. He sees people as instruments.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Such men are in charge. In most civilized countries, the schools serve the state, the church, the nation—not the child.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are exceptions. Denmark. China. But they are few.  \n",

      "Let me work through each text systematically, focusing on the distinctive voice of the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Original's Voice:**\n",
      "The original has a particular philosophical tone that balances formality with accessibility. Key features include:\n",
      "- Direct, matter-of-fact statements (\"The inductive principle, however, is equally incapable...\")\n",
      "- Concrete, vivid examples woven naturally into abstract arguments (\"to expect bread to be more nourishing than a stone\")\n",
      "- A conversational relationship with the reader, using \"we\" inclusively\n",
      "- Measured pacing with neither excessive elaboration nor stark minimalism\n",
      "- Phrases like \"begging the question,\" \"intrinsic evidence,\" \"forgo all justification\"\n",
      "- A distinctive rhythm that moves from principle to example to implication\n",
      "- The memorable image of the friend's body inhabited by an enemy's mind\n",
      "- Chapter transitions that are straightforward and organizational\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT A Analysis:**\n",
      "This text feels like an educational expansion or modernization. The voice is explanatory and pedagogical (\"In other words, any attempt to use past experience...\"). It uses italics for *begging the question*, which the original doesn't. The prose is more explicitly structured with transitional phrases like \"Indeed,\" \"Nor does science escape,\" \"Thus, all knowledge that ventures.\" The tone is that of a textbook or teaching document—clear and systematic but somewhat impersonal. The final paragraph's metaphor about \"pillars that experience alone cannot erect\" feels more contemporary and explanatory than the original's voice. The rhythm is more uniform and less varied than the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT B Analysis:**\n",
      "This text immediately strikes a different register: \"There is a principle, simple in its aspect yet profound in its consequences, which lies at the very foundation...\" This is more ornate, more consciously literary. The prose has a Victorian/Edwardian philosophical grandeur with phrases like \"narrow precincts of immediate experience,\" \"the edifice of science...collapses,\" \"curious and inescapable circle,\" \"psychologically impossible and practically catastrophic.\" The author uses italicized Latin (*petitio principii*), which the original doesn't. The concluding metaphor—\"not a pyramid resting securely on observed facts, is rather a raft floating upon a sea of assumptions\"—is strikingly poetic and memorable in a way that feels consistent with philosophical writing of the early 20th century. The voice has theatrical flair (\"And let it not be thought...\") and builds arguments with rhetorical flourish. This feels like it could be from the same era and philosophical tradition as the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT C Analysis:**\n",
      "This text is notably spare and direct: \"The inductive principle cannot be proven by experience.\" It reads like lecture notes or a philosophical précis—accurate but stripped down. The sentences are shorter and more declarative. There's less imagery and fewer memorable phrases. The examples are present but feel more perfunctory (\"that bread will nourish rather than poison\"). The prose lacks the texture and rhythm of the original—it's efficient rather than engaging. Phrases like \"This, though it may seem counterintuitive\" feel more contemporary and textbook-like. The voice is that of a clear expositor but lacks personality and distinctive character. It's the most utilitarian of the four texts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TEXT D Analysis:**\n",
      "This text opens with a complex, formal construction: \"The principle of induction—by which we infer, from a number of instances that have been observed, a general rule or expectation concerning cases not yet observed—lies at the very foundation...\" The voice is measured and philosophical with phrases like \"transcends immediate experience,\" \"involved in a circle from which there seems no escape.\" The examples feel naturally integrated (\"fire will burn or that water will quench thirst\"). The rhythm alternates between complex and simple sentences in a way that feels authentic to early 20th-century philosophical prose. Phrases like \"to-morrow\" (with hyphen) and \"the deliverances of sense\" suggest period authenticity. The conclusion—\"its foundation remains one of the deep, unsolved mysteries of the human intellect\"—has appropriate gravitas without being overwrought. The voice maintains formality while remaining accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparative Ranking:**\n",
      "\n",
      "TEXT B (Rank 1): Despite its more ornate style, this captures the philosophical voice of the era most completely. The rhetorical structures, the balance of abstraction and concrete example, the relationship with the reader, and the memorable concluding metaphor all feel authentic to early 20th-century philosophical writing. If I encountered this \"in the wild,\" I would most likely attribute it to the same author or tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "TEXT D (Rank 2): This is very close to the original's voice—formal but accessible, with good rhythm and natural integration of examples. The period touches (like \"to-morrow\") and the measured philosophical tone are convincing. It would be difficult to distinguish from the original, though it lacks some of the original's particular turns of phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "TEXT A (Rank 3): This is competent and clear but feels more like a modern educational text. The explanatory style and contemporary framing devices make it feel less like the original author's voice and more like someone explaining that author's ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "TEXT C (Rank 4): This is the least similar—too stripped down, too utilitarian. It captures the content but misses the voice entirely. The prose lacks texture, rhythm, and personality. It reads like efficient notes rather than authored philosophical prose.\n"
