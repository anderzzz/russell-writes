    "# Style Instruction Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates how well derived style instructions enable style replication, compared to alternative approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gold standard text:\n",
    "1. **Flatten**: Extract content while removing style\n",
    "2. **Reconstruct**: Generate text using 4 different methods (M stochastic runs each):\n",
    "   - Generic baseline\n",
    "   - Few-shot learning\n",
    "   - Author name prompting\n",
    "   - Derived style instructions\n",
    "3. **Judge (Blind Comparative)**: Judge ranks all 4 reconstructions from 1-4 based on similarity to original\n",
    "   - **Blind evaluation**: Judge sees only anonymous labels (Text A, B, C, D) - no method names\n",
    "   - **Ranking**: 1 = most similar, 2 = second, 3 = third, 4 = least similar\n",
    "   - **Order randomized**: Position of methods varies across samples to eliminate bias\n",
    "4. **Aggregate**: Analyze rankings to determine which method best captures style\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Crash resilient**: All LLM responses saved to SQLite immediately\n",
    "- **Resume support**: Can restart after failures, skips completed work\n",
    "- **Blind evaluation**: Eliminates judge bias by hiding method names\n",
    "- **Comparative ranking**: More informative than binary comparisons"

      "- Actual effect: moves freedom farther away.  \n",
      "- Mechanism: functions like a business combine that ends competition among dominant firms; advantages for weaker parties are accidental and unlikely.  \n",
      "- Specific consequence for China: domination without formal violation of the Open-Door principle, because U.S. financial and commercial supremacy turns the principle into a guarantee of American control.\n",

      "- Rising purchasing power.  \n",
      "- Prevention of territorial seizures by other powers.  \n",

      "### 3. Capitalist logic on competition  \n",
      "- Ideal outcome for capitalists: eliminate competition among themselves (via Trusts) while preserving competition among workers.  \n",
      "- Trade-union gains inside advanced countries reduce intra-national worker competition but intensify racial conflict, especially between white and Asian labour.  \n",
      "- Under capitalism, cheap Asian labour in white-majority countries harms local wages; under socialism, any immigrant who produces more than he/she consumes raises aggregate wealth and benefits every resident.  \n",
      "- Capitalism therefore artificially pits workers against each other, fostering inefficient production and converting individual self-interest into anti-social behaviour.  \n",

      "- A handful of creditor nations extract wealth from all others.  \n",
      "- Permanent peace under this arrangement requires permanent subjugation of debtor nations.  \n",
      "- China will eventually refuse to leave industrial profits in foreign hands; Russia, once subdued, will likewise rebel.  \n",
      "- No stable world order can emerge from the Washington syndicate; instead, the Marxian class struggle will assume a geopolitical form: Asia (led by socialist Russia) versus the West (led by capitalist America).  \n",

      "- Exclusion of Asians from America and the Dominions is one such issue; it is driven by popular racism and conflicts with finance capital’s desire for cheap labour.  \n",
      "- Capitalism still bears ultimate responsibility because it structures workers’ material interests in an anti-social direction.  \n",

      "- Chinese development via capitalist methods raises prices of export staples (which peasants consume), creates artificial demand for foreign goods, undermines self-sufficiency, and spreads discontent.  \n",
      "- Socialism would eliminate competitive buying and selling; production would be planned to meet consumer needs as determined by the same authority that controls output.  \n",

      "what I mean when I say that this or that is a constituent of a\n",
      "judgment, or of a proposition which we understand. To begin with\n",
      "judgments: a judgment, as an occurrence, I take to be a relation of a\n",
      "mind to several entities, namely, the entities which compose what is\n",
      "judged. If, e.g. I judge that A loves B, the judgment as an event\n",
      "consists in the existence, at a certain moment, of a specific\n",
      "four-term relation, called _judging_, between me and A and love and B.\n",
      "That is to say, at the time when I judge, there is a certain complex\n",
      "whose terms are myself and A and love and B, and whose relating\n",
      "relation is _judging_. My reasons for this view have been set forth\n",
      "elsewhere,[41] and I shall not repeat them here. Assuming this view of\n",
      "judgment, the constituents of the judgment are simply the constituents\n",
      "of the complex which is the judgment. Thus, in the above case, the\n",
      "constituents are myself and A and love and B and judging. But myself\n",
      "and judging are constituents shared by all my judgments; thus the\n",
      "_distinctive_ constituents of the particular judgment in question are\n",
      "A and love and B. Coming now to what is meant by \"understanding a\n",
      "proposition,\" I should say that there is another relation possible\n",
      "between me and A and love and B, which is called my _supposing_ that A\n",
      "loves B.[42] When we can _suppose_ that A loves B, we \"understand the\n",
      "proposition\" _A loves B_. Thus we often understand a proposition in\n",
      "cases where we have not enough knowledge to make a judgment.\n",
      "Supposing, like judging, is a many-term relation, of which a mind is\n",
      "one term. The other terms of the relation are called the constituents\n",
      "of the proposition supposed. Thus the principle which I enunciated may\n",
      "be re-stated as follows: _Whenever a relation of supposing or judging\n",
      "occurs, the terms to which the supposing or judging mind is related by\n",
      "the relation of supposing or judging must be terms with which the mind\n",
      "in question is acquainted._ This is merely to say that we cannot make\n",
      "a judgment or a supposition without knowing what it is that we are\n",
      "making our judgment or supposition about. It seems to me that the\n",
      "truth of this principle is evident as soon as the principle is\n",
      "understood; I shall, therefore, in what follows, assume the principle,\n",
      "and use it as a guide in analysing judgments that contain\n",

      "Returning now to Julius Cæsar, I assume that it will be admitted that\n",
      "he himself is not a constituent of any judgment which I can make. But\n",
      "at this point it is necessary to examine the view that judgments are\n",
      "composed of something called \"ideas,\" and that it is the \"idea\" of\n",
      "Julius Cæsar that is a constituent of my judgment. I believe the\n",
      "plausibility of this view rests upon a failure to form a right theory\n",
      "of descriptions. We may mean by my \"idea\" of Julius Cæsar the things\n",
      "that I know about him, e.g. that he conquered Gaul, was assassinated\n",

      "actually in my mind when I judge about Julius Cæsar, we must\n",

      "whatever else I may have forgotten about him, it is plain that when I\n",

      "I think the theory that judgments consist of ideas may have been\n",
      "suggested in some such way, yet I think the theory itself is\n",
      "fundamentally mistaken. The view seems to be that there is some\n",

      "the mind of the person who has the idea, and that, since judgment is a\n",
      "mental event, its constituents must be constituents of the mind of the\n",

      "outside things--we never really, in knowledge, attain to the things we\n",
      "are supposed to be knowing about, but only to the ideas of those\n",
      "things. The relation of mind, idea, and object, on this view, is\n",
      "utterly obscure, and, so far as I can see, nothing discoverable by\n",
      "inspection warrants the intrusion of the idea between the mind and the\n",
      "object. I suspect that the view is fostered by the dislike of\n",

      "when we are acquainted with an object, there is in us something which\n",
      "can be called the \"idea\" of the object. On the contrary, I hold that\n",
      "acquaintance is wholly a relation, not demanding any such constituent\n",
      "of the mind as is supposed by advocates of \"ideas.\" This is, of\n",
      "course, a large question, and one which would take us far from our\n",
      "subject if it were adequately discussed. I therefore content myself\n",
      "with the above indications, and with the corollary that, in judging,\n",
      "the actual objects concerning which we judge, rather than any supposed\n",
      "purely mental entities, are constituents of the complex which is the\n",

      "This is accomplished by the method of tensors. Some laws which seem\n",

      "To take a simple illustration: Suppose, as in the hypothesis of the\n",

      "you are to find out the change, it cannot be by ordinary measurement;\n",
      "it must be by some such method as the Michelson-Morley experiment, in\n",
      "which the velocity of light is used to measure lengths. Then you still\n",
      "have to decide whether it is simpler to suppose a change of length\n",
      "or a change in the velocity of light. The experimental fact would be\n",
      "that light takes longer to traverse what your foot rule declares to\n",
      "be a given distance in one direction than in another—or, as in the\n",
      "Michelson-Morley experiment, that it ought to take longer but doesn’t.\n",
      "You can adjust your measures to such a fact in various ways; in any\n",
      "way you choose to adopt, there will be an element of convention. This\n",
      "element of convention survives in the laws that you arrive at after\n",
      "you have made your decision as to measures, and often it takes subtle\n",

      "with the example of his parents and other children, only brought him\n",
      "to the point where he could be _near_ the waves without fear. I am\n",
      "convinced that the fear was instinctive; I am fairly certain there had\n",
      "been no suggestion to cause it. The following summer, at the age of\n",
      "three and a half, we took the matter up again. There was still a terror\n",
      "of going actually into the waves. After some unsuccessful coaxing,\n",
      "combined with the spectacle of everybody else bathing, we adopted\n",

      "of his own accord whenever the weather was suitable--obviously with the\n",

      "It is customary, among those who inherit the comfortable empires of the nineteenth century, to speak of peace as though it were a self-evident blessing, like sunlight or maternal affection.  The Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February of 1922 amid a gratifying clatter of battleship rivets, was hailed by the press on both sides of the Pacific as the dawn of a new and costless millennium.  Yet the language of its clauses—so prudently technical, so reassuringly barren of moral enthusiasm—already betrayed the real character of the transaction.  It was, in essence, a cartel among the strong, a gentleman's agreement to suppress the vulgar spectacle of gun-fire while reserving every effective means of economic coercion.  Competition between the great Powers was to be curtailed only in that department where it had become dangerously expensive; in every other sphere the struggle would proceed with a decorum befitting creditors who have discovered that foreclosure is more profitable than riot.\n",
      "\n",
      "China, whose coast-line was the ostensible object of solicitude, received the sort of consideration habitually extended to a bankrupt tenant: the landlord consortium promises not to quarter soldiers in the parlour provided the tenant abandons all claim to the lease.  The Open Door, that euphonious phrase first minted by John Hay, is kept ostentatiously ajar; but what enters through it is not the invigorating draught of free competition, rather the slow, colourless suffocation of financial preponderance.  American oil, American railways, American banking houses, acting in concert if not in formal conspiracy, will determine, without the formality of a customs tariff, what China may import, what she may export, and what margin of profit she may be permitted to retain for purposes of her own civilisation.  Thus the Treaty secures peace—of a sort.  It is the peace that prevails between a lion and a herd of gazelles when the lion has dined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The avowed aims of American policy in China—stable government, increased purchasing power, the prevention of fresh territorial scrambles—are such as any candid imperialist might advance in a missionary tract.  They coincide with Chinese welfare precisely so long as that welfare is defined in terms of a market: order is desirable because tumult discourages orders, prosperity because paupers are indifferent customers.  Where the definitions diverge, divergence is treated as sedition.  A railway constructed by Chinese engineers, owned by Chinese shareholders, and designed to carry Chinese troops is, from the standpoint of Wall Street, an incipient Bolshevik; a mine from which the Peking Government might draw royalties is a subversive pamphlet in the form of real estate.  Students who propose that wealth produced in China should remain in China are shadowed, reported, and, when expedient, deported; their notebooks are scrutinised with the anxious vigilance once reserved for anarchist handbills in Chicago.  Even literature is conscripted: when Gorky, whose beard is more formidable than any Russian fleet, ventured to speak of human brotherhood to an American audience, he was informed that the Statue of Liberty is privately owned and reserves the right to refuse admission.  The ultimate ambition, naïvely revealed in the bulletins of the Chamber of Commerce, is to transform the entire Celestial Republic into a replica of Des Moines, decorated with electric signs in praise of chewing-gum, and regulated by ordinances against spitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the United States the same logic is carried a stage further.  Capitalism, when it has succeeded in organising producers into Trusts, discovers that competition among capitalists is as inconvenient as competition among cannibals at the same banquet.  It therefore abolishes it.  But competition among workers, being a convenient method of keeping wages low, is sedulously preserved.  Trade-unions, so far as they diminish this competition inside a single country, are tolerated; indeed, they are occasionally praised by stockbrokers who have no intention of employing manual labour.  Yet the moment the principle is extended across racial frontiers it becomes intolerable.  Cheap coloured labour, if admitted freely to California or Australia, would undermine the standard of life which white artisans have painfully achieved; if excluded, the coloured races are condemned to perpetual inferiority, and the world is deprived of whatever contributions they might make to science, art, or political invention.  Capitalism, having first created the economic incentive for migration, proceeds to inflame the racial antagonisms which that migration awakens.  Under a socialist regime the dilemma disappears.  An immigrant who produces more than he consumes adds, by the mere fact of his presence, to the aggregate wealth which is shared by all; his arrival is therefore welcomed, not resented.  The present system, by divorcing private gain from public advantage, converts every newcomer into a menace and every citizen into a watch-dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the grander scale of international finance the same mechanism operates with the impersonal majesty of a natural law.  A dozen banking houses, situated for the most part within the square mile known as the City of London or the narrower rectangle of Wall Street, have acquired the habit of advancing capital to every government, revolutionary or reactionary, that can offer a customs house or a petroleum concession as collateral.  The interest which accrues must be paid in goods; the goods must be shipped; the ships must be protected; the protection must be financed by fresh loans.  Thus the creditor nations, without ever planting a flag or proclaiming a protectorate, extract from the debtor nations an annual tribute heavier than any tribute exacted by Rome.  Permanent peace under such an arrangement would require the permanent submissiveness of the debtor, a condition which history suggests is as unstable as the permanent submissiveness of the proletariat within a single state.  China will not forever acquiesce in the polite legal fiction that a railway built on her soil, with her labour, and for her transport, is nevertheless the private property of an absentee corporation registered in Delaware.  Russia, once the Allied bayonets are withdrawn, will resume that experiment in social ownership which the Allies intervened to suppress.  The class struggle, having outgrown the boundaries of the nation-state, will array itself along racial and continental lines: the East, led by a socialist Russia regenerated by defeat, against the West, led by a capitalist America bloated with victory.  The war which would then ensue would be waged, on the Eastern side, for the liberation of Asia; but the weapons of modern chemistry are no respecters of motive, and it is probable that the civilisation which emerged, if any emerged, would bear as little resemblance to either Confucian humanism or Jeffersonian democracy as a lava-field bears to the garden it has obliterated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against this prospect the defenders of the existing order offer two palliatives, each internally consistent and each incompatible with the other.  The first is the peace of acquiescence: the debtor nations shall accept their status with the cheerful fatalism of a Calvinist congregation assured that poverty is pre-ordained.  The second is the freedom of perpetual competition: every nation shall retain the right to struggle, provided the struggle is conducted with due regard for the rules drawn up by the victors of the last encounter.  Neither programme can be permanently enforced.  Acquiescence, when it is maintained by the periodic display of gun-boats, engenders the very resentments which explode in fresh wars; competition, when it is confined to the weaker parties, merely multiplies the occasions for intervention by the stronger.  The attempt to combine the two—to secure simultaneously the tranquillity of empire and the dynamism of private enterprise—results in that curious oscillation between philanthropy and bombardment which has lately become the distinguishing mark of Western policy in the Far East.\n",
      "\n",
      "The root of the impasse lies deeper than diplomacy or racial prejudice: it is embedded in the very structure of production for profit.  So long as goods are manufactured, not because they are needed, but because their sale promises a surplus to the manufacturer, every consumer remains a potential enemy of every other, and every nation a potential enemy of every other nation.  The Chinese peasant who is induced to purchase Lancashire cotton instead of homespun must first be deprived of the alternative; the American workman who is induced to fear Chinese competition must first be persuaded that his standard of life depends upon the exclusion, not the elevation, of his Chinese brother.  Under socialism the same authority which decides what shall be produced decides also who shall consume it; the conflict of buyer against buyer, of seller against seller, of race against race, is therefore abolished at a stroke.  Until that transformation is accomplished, the most that can be hoped from international conferences is a temporary truce among the predators, papered over with clauses as innocuous as they are verbose.  Peace and freedom, if they are to be more than rhetorical flourishes in a presidential message, require the courage to abolish the economic system which makes them mutually exclusive.  Until that courage is forthcoming, the choice before mankind remains the choice which capitalism has always presented: the quiet of the prison-yard or the tumult of the battlefield.  Neither, in the end, is compatible with the dignity of creatures who once dreamed that they were made in the image of God.\n",

      "The Washington naval treaty, hailed in every cable despatch as a charter of perpetual concord, is in truth nothing more edifying than the legalisation of a cartel.  The four great Powers have done exactly what the Steel Trust once did within the borders of a single nation: they have agreed to divide the market, to freeze the rate of profit, and to strangle every potential competitor at birth.  That the commodity here bartered is not steel but battleship tonnage, and that the market is the basin of the Pacific rather than the basin of the Great Lakes, alters the moral quality of the transaction not one whit.  A combine is a combine; and the moment competition disappears among the strong the weak discover that what was formerly called freedom of the seas has become the right to drown quietly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "China, whose coast-line stretches for two thousand miles within the scope of the treaty, is invited to applaud this arrangement on the ground that the Open Door still stands open.  The phrase sounds reassuring until one observes that the door now opens into an American warehouse.  Financial supremacy has succeeded to territorial annexation; the dollar, not the drill, is the instrument of subjugation.  The Open Door, interpreted by Wall Street, means that every Chinese railway concession must be so mortgaged to American bankers that the interest, whatever the nominal ownership, is remitted to New York.  It means that the mines of Shansi must be exploited by syndicates whose shareholders live in Boston and whose accountants balance the books in gold.  It means, in short, that China may retain the shadow of sovereignty provided she surrenders the substance of economic independence.  The treaty does not violate the Open Door; it merely transforms it into a revolting turnstile through which the Chinese must pass in order to be fleeced.\n",
      "\n",
      "This procedure is represented in the American press as a disinterested solicitude for Chinese welfare.  Let us grant that certain American desires do indeed coincide with what the more enlightened Chinese desire.  A stable central government, an increase in the purchasing power of the peasant, the prevention of further territorial mutilation by Japan or Russia—these are advantages which even a nationalist Chinese might welcome.  But they are the incidental by-products of a policy whose dominant purpose is the security of American capital.  The moment Chinese welfare conflicts with that purpose the mask is dropped with astonishing rapidity.  The moment a Chinese ministry proposes to operate the Peking–Hankow railway as a state enterprise, American financiers discover that such socialism is incompatible with the sacred rights of bondholders.  The moment Chinese students in California proclaim that the wealth produced in China ought to remain in China, their names are inscribed upon a confidential blacklist circulated among the immigration authorities, with the result that a return ticket to San Francisco becomes mysteriously valueless.  The moment the Chinese aesthetic tradition expresses itself in a pavilion roofed with yellow tiles, the American missionary, whose own meeting-house is of grim red brick, denounces the pavilion as idolatrous and petitions the municipality to replace it by a symmetrical Y.M.C.A.  The sum of these interventions is to oblige China to imitate the United States in every particular except the capacity to retain her own surplus value; and a civilization which is compelled to imitate another while simultaneously surrendering its revenues is, whatever the legal formulae, a colony in the making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the United States the same logic is already visible in the relations of capital to labour.  The ideal of every great trust is to abolish competition among entrepreneurs while preserving it among wage-earners.  The steel-master who welcomes the amalgamation of two rival corporations will resist with equal enthusiasm the amalgamation of two rival trade-unions, because the first manoeuvre raises prices while the second raises wages.  When the workers of his own country have succeeded, by means of collective bargaining, in reducing the competition which depresses their standard of life, the trust proceeds to import Chinese or Japanese labour in order to recreate that competition in a more virulent racial form.  Thus the internal victory of organized labour merely displaces the battle-ground; the conflict between white and Asian workers is the old domestic conflict between capital and labour writ large across the Pacific.  Under capitalism the immigrant from Asia is a threat because he is obliged to produce more than he consumes in order to pay interest to the bondholder; under socialism the same immigrant, relieved of this tribute, would add to the common stock, and every resident, instead of competing with him, would benefit by his surplus product.  The immigration question, therefore, is insoluble within the framework of the profit system, because the system itself creates the antagonism which it afterwards deplores.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same contradiction reappears on the international plane.  A handful of creditor nations, of which the United States is now the foremost, have succeeded in concentrating the liquid resources of the planet in their own banking centres.  They are prepared to concede peace, but only on condition that the tribute continues to flow.  Permanent peace, under such auspices, means nothing more edifying than the permanent subjugation of the debtor world.  Yet the historical process which enabled the West to accumulate these credits is simultaneously generating the forces which will repudiate them.  China, once she has acquired the rudiments of industrial technique, will refuse to leave the profits of her factories in foreign hands; Russia, even if she be temporarily subdued, will in due season assert the same refusal on behalf of the peasants of the Ukraine.  The Washington syndicate, therefore, is doomed in advance; the only question is whether it will collapse quietly, like a bankrupt bank, or whether it will drag the entire world into the liquidation of a general war.  Such a war, when it comes, will wear the outward dress of a conflict between Asia and the West, between a socialist Russia leading the coloured races and a capitalist America heading the white; but its essence will be the ancient Marxian class-struggle translated from the vocabulary of factory hands and mill-owners into the vocabulary of continents.  And because the stakes will be nothing less than the right of whole peoples to exist as civilized nations, the weapons employed will be such that, whoever is adjudged victorious, the very notion of civilization may succumb in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is sometimes objected that these consequences are too vast to be laid at the door of a mere economic system.  Surely, the critic urges, the popular passions which demand the exclusion of Asiatic labour from California are spontaneous, and cannot be imputed to the machinations of Wall Street.  The objection is valid so far as it goes; there are issues, and the colour question is one of them, upon which the ordinary voter feels more intensely than the most cosmopolitan financier.  But the passions themselves have been nourished by the material interests which the system engenders.  The white worker who supports an exclusion law is not inventing a prejudice; he is responding to a real threat to his standard of life which the capitalist method of production first creates and then exploits.  Capitalism, by divorcing the individual interest from the common interest, has made it rational for the American mechanic to fear the Chinese coolie, just as it has made it rational for the Lancashire mill-owner to welcome him.  Under a system which produced for use instead of for profit, the same coolie would be an economic asset to both; under the present system he is a weapon in the hands of one class against another.  The responsibility of capitalism is therefore ultimate, even when the immediate agents of oppression are the prejudices of the multitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contrast between production for profit and production for use is not a merely academic subtlety; it is the clue to every deadlock which the modern world exhibits.  Capitalism must sell before it can produce, and in order to sell it must create a scarcity of purchasing power among the many while it accumulates an excess of capital among the few.  Hence the paradox of idle factories beside hungry populations, of wheat burnt in Iowa while peasants starve in Hunan.  Apply the same logic to China and you obtain the following prognosis.  A railway built by foreign capital will raise the price of the soya beans which the peasant eats, because the beans must now travel to a port where they can be exchanged for foreign textiles.  The peasant, compelled to buy what he formerly produced for himself, becomes discontented; the foreign investor, compelled to find markets for his textiles, becomes alarmed; the Chinese government, caught between two incompatible necessities, becomes unstable.  Every thread in the web tightens the knot which it was ostensibly intended to loosen.  Under socialism the same railway would be built, but the beans would travel only so far as the central planning authority decreed them necessary for Chinese consumption; the textiles would be manufactured, not in Manchester, but in the mills newly erected at Hankow; and the surplus value, instead of being remitted to London or New York, would be reinvested in further Chinese enterprises.  The peasant would eat, the worker would be employed, the investor would receive, not interest, but an equivalent allocation of the social product.  Competition, exploitation, imperial rivalry, would disappear because the motive which generates them—the quest of private profit—would have disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ledger is finally balanced, capitalism offers to the world a choice of evils so stark that every euphemism becomes an insult to intelligence.  It can give peace, but the peace will be that of a prison; it can give freedom, but the freedom will be that of a battlefield.  It cannot give both together, because the condition of its own existence is the simultaneous exploitation of class by class and of nation by nation.  American policy, whatever the benevolent phrases in which it is cloaked, must in the long run drive China to the same dilemma.  If China submits, she will enjoy the peace of the slave; if she rebels,\n",

      "The ink on the Washington naval treaty was still damp when the world’s newspapers hailed it as a “charter of peace.”  Diplomats spoke of an open-door that would now swing safely for every nation, big or small; editorialists dreamed of a Pacific finally as pacific as its name.  Yet beneath the ceremonial language the pact was nothing more than a gentlemen’s agreement among the biggest firms in the global marketplace—an armistice among sharks that leaves the smaller fish no less edible.  Like the great industrial trusts that had already carved up the American home market, the four-power combine froze the shares of the dominant naval powers and declared further competition “destabilizing.”  Any benefit that might trickle down to weaker states was purely coincidental, and coincidences are poor foundations for national survival.  For China, the illusion was especially cruel: the Open-Door principle survived on paper, but the door itself now opened only far enough to admit the particular silhouette of American finance.  No flag had to be lowered, no customs post transferred; mere supremacy of dollars and credits was sufficient to turn independence into a protectorate in all but name.\n",
      "\n",
      "American statesmen insisted that their interest in China coincided with the aspirations of the Chinese people.  Orderly government, a rising standard of living, freedom from further territorial amputations—these were noble goals, and, up to a point, sincerely professed.  Yet the moment Chinese reformers proposed that the railways, mines, and steamship lines be owned or even regulated by the Chinese themselves, the language of mutual benefit cooled.  State ownership was denounced as “socialistic,” a breach of the very Open-Door whose purpose, it now appeared, was to guarantee that American capital, not Chinese planners, would do the opening.  Consular officers in Shanghai kept card-indexes of students who attended Marxist study circles; radicals arriving at San Francisco were photographed, interrogated, and sometimes shipped back across the ocean before they could set foot on the campus of Berkeley or Stanford.  When Maxim Gorky visited the United States to raise money for revolutionaries at home, he was hounded out of New York hotels for the moral crime of not being married to the woman with whom he traveled.  American missionaries meanwhile applauded the demolition of “unsanitary” Chinese architecture and its replacement by neat, utilitarian rows of shops—substantial dividends on the civilizing investment.  Industrial profits, however, were not to be reinvested in Chinese schools or hospitals; they were wired eastward to Wall Street, westward to San Francisco, and the surplus that might have financed an indigenous renaissance departed with them.  China was thus invited to become a younger edition of the United States, provided it first surrendered the surplus that might have made it something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same logic governs the internal order of every capitalist nation.  Inside the trust, competition is condemned as wasteful; among workers it is cultivated as a moral duty.  The steel magnate applauds combination in his own boardroom and deplores it in the trade-union hall.  When white workers in California or British Columbia win a shorter working day, their victory is instantly offset by the importation of Asian labor willing to accept lower wages; when Asian laborers organize, they are met by exclusion laws and race riots.  Thus the system stages a perpetual tournament of the oppressed, awarding temporary privileges to one group only to withdraw them at the next turn of the labor market.  Under socialism the arithmetic is reversed.  An immigrant who consumes less than he produces automatically raises the collective wealth; every resident, native or foreign, has a material interest in the newcomer’s success.  Only when production is organized for use rather than profit does the stranger cease to be a threat and become simply a neighbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the world stage the same tournament is played with nations instead of individuals.  A handful of creditor powers—chiefly the United States, Great Britain, and France—have become the financial trust of the planet, pooling their political resources to extract interest, dividends, and raw materials from the rest of mankind.  Permanent peace under such an arrangement would require the permanent subjugation of the debtor world, a condition no people will endure indefinitely.  China may today be too weak to reclaim the profits that American mills and mines are siphoning from the Yangtze valley, but a day will come when it insists on controlling the surplus it creates.  Russia, momentarily humbled by civil war and blockade, will likewise reassert its right to develop without paying tribute to foreign bondholders.  The Washington syndicate, like every cartel, contains the seeds of its own dissolution; the only question is whether the breakup will take the form of negotiated revolution or of a war that pits an Asia awakened by socialist Russia against a West still organized for capitalist expansion.  Such a conflict would be fought in the name of Asian freedom, yet the weapons of modern destruction are indiscriminate; the civilization that emerged, if any emerged at all, would bear little resemblance to the cultures that marched into battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even within the imperial heartlands, policy is shaped less by the deliberations of foreign offices than by the tug-of-war between finance capital and those popular passions it cannot buy off.  The exclusion of Asian immigrants from the United States, Canada, and Australia is one of the rare questions on which the streetcar conductor and the bank president openly disagree.  Wall Street would welcome an unlimited supply of cheap labor; white labor, already haunted by the specter of unemployment, demands racial barricades.  Yet capitalism cannot wash its hands of the hatred it has conjured into existence.  By teaching every worker that his fellow man is a competitor for a job, a wage, a roof, the profit system converts the most ordinary self-interest into anti-social passion.  Racism is not an accidental blemish upon the fair skin of free enterprise; it is the predictable rash that appears whenever the market rubs different peoples together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deeper contradiction lies in the very purpose of production.  Capitalist industry manufactures not to satisfy human needs but to realize a price, and the gap between the two motives is the space in which competition, exploitation, and war breed unchecked.  Let Chinese agriculture be capitalized, and the first result is a rise in the price of soybean oil and cotton cloth—the staples millions of peasants must buy.  Let foreign mills be erected in Shanghai, and artificial demand is created for the gadgets and fashions whose production is profitable to the investor.  Self-sufficient handicraft villages collapse; discontent travels faster than the railroads that carry it.  Under socialism, by contrast, the same authority that decides what shall be produced decides who needs it.  Buying and selling cease to be the nervous system of society; they shrink to the simple bookkeeping of distribution.  Competition becomes as anachronistic as the duel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capitalism, then, offers the world a choice but denies it the third term that alone would make the choice bearable.  It can give peace, but only the peace of the barracks, the peace that accompanies the surrender of weaker peoples to their exploiters.  Or it can give a measure of freedom, but only the freedom of the jungle, the freedom to struggle perpetually against one’s fellows and one’s neighbors.  What it cannot give is both peace and freedom together.  The United States may succeed for a season in pacifying the Pacific, yet every concession exacted from China in the name of stability plants the seeds of future revolt.  Every gunboat that guards an American oil lease at Jiujiang, every customs official who collects interest on a loan floated in 1911, is a recruiting agent for the revolution that will one day answer force with force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only international socialism can break the vicious circle.  By replacing production for profit with production for use, it removes the material basis of imperial rivalry.  By making every worker a co-owner of the world’s wealth, it turns the immigrant, the foreigner, the stranger, into a partner instead of a competitor.  Peace achieved on such foundations would not be the temporary lull that follows a successful police action; it would be the quiet that accompanies justice.  Until that transformation occurs, even the peace now so loudly celebrated will remain unstable, for capitalism can maintain it only by fresh doses of oppression, and oppression in the long run educates its victims in the art of revolt.  The choice before the modern world is therefore not between peace and freedom, but between the imperial peace that masks exploitation and the socialist peace that alone can make freedom universal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "INSTRUCTIONS\n",
      "===================\n",
      "\n",
      "Capitalism cannot deliver both peace and freedom.  \n",
      "Any peace it grants is an imperial peace—an armistice among the strong purchased with the liberty of the weak. Only international socialism can reconcile the two goods, because only socialism abolishes the private ownership that turns every gain for one nation into a loss for another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington Naval Treaty illustrates the bargain. Signed in 1922 by the United States, Britain, France and Japan, the four-power pact claimed to safeguard peace by limiting naval armaments. In fact it functions exactly like a business combine that ends price-wars among dominant firms while freezing smaller competitors out of the market. The treaty’s clauses allocate tonnage ratios—5:5:3:1.75—so neatly that one can almost see the board-room table at which the quotas were traded. China, though not even present, received the largest invisible share: the promise that her coasts would not be blockaded by rival fleets. What she actually received was domination without formal violation of the Open-Door principle, because American financial and commercial supremacy turns the principle itself into a guarantee of American control. Peace is preserved, but the price is China’s freedom to shape her own industrial future.\n",
      "\n",
      "American policy in China advertises a partial overlap of interests. Washington desires a stable government, rising purchasing power, and the prevention of further territorial seizures by other powers. These goals coincide with Chinese welfare so long as “welfare” is defined as the capacity to buy more American goods. They diverge the moment China claims the right to own or operate her own railways and mines, or to experiment with state capitalism, or to educate students in socialist economics without surveillance and black-listing, or to retain profits from her own soil. When the writer Maxim Gorky visited the United States in 1906 he was expelled within weeks for violating American moral standards; Chinese students who advocate land nationalisation meet subtler but equally effective exclusion. Indigenous aesthetics—courtyard houses, hand-painted sign-boards, street theatre—are replaced by utilitarian tidiness: straight roads, electric signs, nickelodeons. The pattern is unmistakable: China must imitate the United States while surrendering her surplus wealth, thereby losing the capacity to contribute a distinctive civilisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capitalist logic prescribes the elimination of competition among capitalists and its preservation among workers. Inside the advanced countries Trusts and cartels fix prices, divide markets, and pool patents; simultaneously trade-union gains reduce competition among native workers but intensify racial conflict, especially between white and Asian labour. Under capitalism an immigrant from China who accepts low wages appears as a threat to the American standard of life; under socialism the same immigrant, producing more than he consumes, raises the aggregate wealth and benefits every resident. The difference is not in the immigrant but in the social framework. Capitalism converts individual self-interest into anti-social behaviour by tethering livelihood to private profit; socialism aligns private and collective interest by making the community’s wealth the individual’s security. The immigration question, therefore, cannot be solved by quotas or exclusion laws. It can be solved only by abolishing the profit system that pits worker against worker across racial lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global financial concentration has already created a world divided into creditor and debtor nations. A handful of states—chiefly the United States, Britain and France—extract annual tribute from every other region. Permanent peace under this arrangement would require the permanent subjugation of the debtor nations, something human nature will not endure. China will eventually refuse to leave industrial profits in foreign hands; Russia, once subdued, will likewise rebel. No stable world order can emerge from the Washington syndicate; instead the Marxian class struggle will assume geopolitical dress: Asia, led by a socialist Russia, against the West, led by a capitalist America. Such a war would be fought for Asian freedom, but the scale of destruction promised by modern technique would probably obliterate every existing civilisation. Capitalism thus prepares its own grave-diggers and furnishes them with dynamite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real power in every capitalist country rests with the great financiers—except on questions that arouse mass emotion. The exclusion of Asians from the United States and the Dominions is one such question. Popular racism demands exclusion; finance capital, eager for cheap labour, would prefer admission. The contradiction is genuine, yet capitalism bears ultimate responsibility, because it structures workers’ material interests in an anti-social direction. Under the profit system the individual gain of the American worker—higher wages secured by excluding competitors—clashes with the common good of the international working class. Harmony is accidental and rare; conflict is systemic and permanent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Production for profit rather than for use generates every major evil of the age. Capitalism does not ask whether people need goods; it asks only whether the goods can be sold at a profit. Hence the spectacle of wheat burned while millions starve, of houses standing empty while families sleep in the streets, of armaments piling up while schools lack books. Chinese development conducted by capitalist methods raises the price of export staples which Chinese peasants must buy, creates artificial demand for foreign manufactures, undermines village self-sufficiency, and spreads discontent like a stain. Socialism would eliminate competitive buying and selling; production would be planned to meet consumer needs as determined by the same authority that controls output. The result would be not perfect abundance but the removal of the artificial scarcity that capitalism must periodically reproduce to keep prices high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final balance sheet is inexorable. Capitalism offers two incompatible options: peace through submission to exploitation, or a measure of freedom through perpetual conflict. It cannot deliver both peace and freedom simultaneously. The United States may, by a combination of naval treaties, dollar diplomacy and cultural missionary work, secure a temporary peace, but the peace will inevitably erode the freedom of weaker nations, China foremost among them. Only international socialism can guarantee both lasting peace and genuine freedom; until it is established, even peace will remain unstable, because capitalist oppression continually incites the revolt that makes peace impossible.\n",

      "Let me carefully analyze the original's distinctive voice and compare each reconstruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Original's Stylistic Fingerprint:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The original has a direct, argumentative, almost conversational voice. Russell writes with clarity and force, building arguments through concrete examples rather than elaborate metaphors. Key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Straightforward declarative sentences** that state positions bluntly (\"But it is impossible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear\")\n",
      "2. **Concrete, specific examples** (Gorky's expulsion, the dossier of students, Open Door principle)\n",
      "3. **Logical progression** with clear signposting (\"To sum up,\" \"But,\" \"Hence\")\n",
      "4. **Restrained rhetoric** - persuasive but not ornate\n",
      "5. **Mix of sentence lengths** with some long analytical sentences but also punchy short ones\n",
      "6. **Direct address of counter-arguments** in a matter-of-fact tone\n",
      "7. **Technical precision** when needed (State Capitalism, State Socialism) without excessive elaboration\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text A Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This text is highly literary and ornate. Opening with \"It is customary, among those who inherit the comfortable empires of the nineteenth century\" - this is elegant but far more elaborate than Russell's style. The metaphors are extended and self-conscious: \"the slow, colourless suffocation of financial preponderance,\" \"It is the peace that prevails between a lion and a herd of gazelles when the lion has dined.\" The prose is consciously artful with phrases like \"gratifying clatter of battleship rivets\" and \"euphonious phrase first minted by John Hay.\" The final sentence about \"creatures who once dreamed that they were made in the image of God\" is poetic in a way Russell rarely is. This feels like someone imitating a more ornate early-20th-century style, but it's too literary, too self-aware of its own eloquence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text B Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This text opens with a thesis statement in a stark, almost outline format: \"Capitalism cannot deliver both peace and freedom.\" It then proceeds systematically, almost like a policy brief. The language is cleaner and more direct than Text A, but it feels compressed and summarized. Phrases like \"The treaty's clauses allocate tonnage ratios—5:5:3:1.75—so neatly that one can almost see the board-room table\" include specific details Russell might use, but the overall structure is too neat, too organized. The paragraphs feel like bullet points expanded. The transitions are mechanical (\"American policy in China advertises...,\" \"Capitalist logic prescribes...\"). The conclusion \"The final balance sheet is inexorable\" is too programmatic. This reads like a competent summary of Russell's arguments but lacks the natural flow of his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text C Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This opens with \"The Washington naval treaty, hailed in every cable despatch as a charter of perpetual concord, is in truth nothing more edifying than the legalisation of a cartel.\" The phrase \"nothing more edifying\" has a Russellian ring. The concrete comparison to the Steel Trust is exactly the kind of analogy Russell uses. \"A combine is a combine; and the moment competition disappears among the strong the weak discover that what was formerly called freedom of the seas has become the right to drown quietly\" - this has Russell's combination of bluntness and controlled irony. The text maintains this balance throughout: specific examples (Peking-Hankow railway, yellow tiles vs. red brick), clear logical structure, but without excessive ornamentation. The phrase \"The treaty does not violate the Open Door; it merely transforms it into a revolting turnstile through which the Chinese must pass in order to be fleeced\" is sharp but not overwrought. However, the text cuts off abruptly mid-sentence, which is unfortunate but doesn't affect the style of what's there.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text D Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Opens with \"The ink on the Washington naval treaty was still damp when the world's newspapers hailed it as a 'charter of peace.'\" This is vivid but slightly more journalistic than Russell's typical opening. The phrase \"an armistice among sharks that leaves the smaller fish no less edible\" is metaphorical in a way that feels slightly forced. The text has good moments: \"coincidences are poor foundations for national survival\" is Russellian. But there are also passages that feel too elaborate: \"the door itself now opened only far enough to admit the particular silhouette of American finance\" - \"particular silhouette\" is a bit precious. The discussion of Gorky includes details Russell mentions but expands them in a slightly melodramatic way. Overall, this text has energy and conviction but occasionally overreaches into more florid territory than Russell typically occupies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparative Ranking:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Text C feels most authentic - it has Russell's directness, his concrete examples, his controlled irony, and his logical progression without excessive ornamentation. The voice is confident and clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text A is too literary and self-consciously eloquent. It's beautifully written but doesn't sound like Russell - it sounds like someone writing in a more ornate early-20th-century style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text D has moments of authenticity but occasionally becomes too metaphorical or journalistic. It's closer to Russell than A but not as consistent as C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text B is the most problematic - it reads like a competent summary or outline of Russell's arguments but lacks the natural voice and flow. It's too compressed and systematic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore: C (1), D (2), A (3), B (4)\n"
