      "  perception, three things are possible. Either the impression is so\n",

      "\n",
      "**Consider questions such as:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Does syntactic structure create space for lexical precision?\n",

      "Certain subjects, of great utilitarian importance, would have to be\n",
      "taught to everybody. Among these, I should include anatomy, physiology\n",
      "and hygiene, to the extent that is likely to be required in adult daily\n",
      "life. But perhaps these subjects ought to come at an earlier stage,\n",
      "since they are naturally connected with sex education, which ought to\n",
      "be given, as far as possible, before puberty. The objection to putting\n",
      "them very early is that they ought not to be forgotten before they are\n",
      "needed. I think the only solution is to give them twice over, once,\n",
      "very simply and in bare outline, before puberty, and again later in\n",
      "connection with elementary knowledge about health and disease. I should\n",
      "say that every pupil ought to know something also about Parliament and\n",
      "the Constitution, but care must be taken to prevent teaching on this\n",
      "subject from degenerating into political propaganda.\n",
      "\n",
      "More important than the curriculum is the question of the methods of\n",
      "teaching and the spirit in which the teaching is given. As to this,\n",
      "the main problem is to make the work interesting without making it too\n",
      "easy. Exact and detailed study should be supplemented by books and\n",
      "lectures on general aspects of the studies concerned. Before sitting\n",
      "down to a Greek play, I would have the students read a translation, by\n",
      "Gilbert Murray or some other translator with a poetic gift. Mathematics\n",
      "should be diversified by an occasional lecture on the history of\n",
      "mathematical discovery, and on the influence of this or that piece of\n",
      "mathematics upon science and daily life, with hints of the delightful\n",
      "things to be found in higher mathematics. Similarly the detailed study\n",
      "of history should be supplemented by brilliant outlines, even if they\n",
      "contained questionable generalizations. The students might be told\n",
      "that the generalizations are doubtful, and be invited to consider\n",
      "their detailed knowledge as supporting or refuting them. In science,\n",
      "it is good to read popular books which give an _aperçu_ of recent\n",
      "research, in order to have some idea of the general scientific purpose\n",
      "served by particular facts and laws. All these things are useful as\n",
      "incentives to exact and minute study, but are pernicious if they are\n",
      "treated as substitutes for it. Pupils must not be encouraged to think\n",
      "that there are short cuts to knowledge. This is a real danger in\n",
      "modern education, owing to the reaction against the old severe drill.\n",
      "The mental work involved in the drill was good; what was bad was the\n",
      "killing of intellectual interests. We must try to secure the hard work,\n",
      "but by other methods than those of the old disciplinarian. I do not\n",
      "believe this is impossible. One finds in America that men who were idle\n",
      "as undergraduates work hard in the law school or the medical school,\n",
      "because at last they are doing work which strikes them as important.\n",
      "That is the essence of the matter: make the school work seem important\n",
      "to the pupils, and they will work hard. But if you make the work too\n",
      "easy, they will know, almost by instinct, that you are not giving\n",
      "them what is really worth having. Clever boys and girls like to test\n",
      "their minds on difficulties. With good teaching and the elimination of\n",

      "lethargic.\n",
      "\n",
      "All through education, initiative should come from the pupil as far as\n",
      "possible. Madame Montessori has shown how this can be done with very\n",
      "young children, but with older children different methods are required.\n",
      "It is, I think, generally recognized by progressive educationists that\n",
      "there should be much more individual work and much less class-work\n",
      "than has been customary, though the individual work should be done in\n",
      "a room full of other boys and girls similarly engaged. Libraries and\n",
      "laboratories should be adequate and roomy. A considerable part of the\n",
      "working day should be set apart for voluntary self-directed study, but\n",
      "the pupil should write an account of what he or she is studying, with\n",
      "an abstract of any information acquired. This helps to fix things in\n",
      "the memory, to make reading have a purpose instead of being desultory,\n",
      "and to give the teacher just that amount of control which may be\n",
      "necessary in each case. The cleverer the pupil, the less control is\n",
      "required. With those who are not very clever it will be necessary to\n",
      "give a great deal of guidance; but even with them it should be by way\n",
      "of suggestion, inquiry, and stimulus rather than by command. There\n",
      "should, however, also be set themes, giving practice in ascertaining\n",
      "the facts about some prescribed subject, and in presenting them in an\n",
      "orderly manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to regular work, boys and girls ought to be encouraged to\n",
      "take an interest in current controversial questions of importance,\n",
      "political, social, and even theological. They should be encouraged to\n",
      "read all sides in such controversies, not only the orthodox side. If\n",
      "any of them have strong feelings on one side or the other, they should\n",
      "be told how to find out facts which support their view, and should be\n",
      "set to debate with those who hold the opposite view. Debates, conducted\n",
      "seriously with a view to ascertaining the truth, could be of great\n",
      "value. In these, the teacher should learn not to take sides, even if he\n",
      "or she has strong convictions. If almost all the pupils take one side,\n",
      "the teacher should take the other, saying that it is only for purposes\n",
      "of argument. Otherwise, his part should be confined to correcting\n",
      "mistakes as to facts. By such means, the pupils could learn discussion\n",
      "as a means of ascertaining truth, not as a contest for rhetorical\n",
      "victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were at the head of a school for older boys and girls, I should\n",
      "consider it equally undesirable to shirk current questions and to do\n",
      "propaganda about them. It is a good thing to make pupils feel that\n",
      "their education is fitting them to cope with matters about which the\n",
      "world is excited; it gives them a sense that scholastic teaching is\n",
      "not divorced from the practical world. But I should not urge my own\n",
      "views upon the pupils. What I should do is to put before them the ideal\n",
      "of a scientific attitude to practical questions. I should expect them\n",
      "to produce arguments that are arguments, and facts that are facts. In\n",
      "politics, especially, this habit is as rare as it is valuable. Every\n",
      "vehement political party generates a cocoon of myth, within which its\n",
      "mentality peacefully slumbers. Passion, too often, kills intellect;\n",
      "in intellectuals, on the contrary, intellect not infrequently kills\n",
      "passion. My aim would be to avoid both these misfortunes. Passionate\n",
      "feeling is desirable, provided it is not destructive; intellect is\n",
      "desirable, with the same proviso. I should wish the fundamental\n",
      "political passions to be constructive, and I should try to make the\n",
      "intellect serve these passions. But it must serve them genuinely,\n",
      "objectively, not only in the world of dreams. When the real world is\n",
      "not sufficiently flattering we all tend to take refuge in an imaginary\n",
      "world, where our desires are gratified without great effort. This\n",
      "is the essence of hysteria. It is also the source of nationalist,\n",
      "theological, and class myths. It shows a weakness of character which\n",
      "is almost universal in the present world. To combat this weakness\n",
      "of character should be one of the aims of later school education.\n",
      "There are two ways of combating it, both necessary, though in a sense\n",
      "opposites. The one is to increase our sense of what we can achieve in\n",
      "the world of reality; the other is to make us more sensitive to what\n",
      "reality can do in the way of dispelling our dreams. Both are comprised\n",
      "in the principle of living objectively rather than subjectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The classic example of subjectivity is Don Quixote. The first time he\n",
      "made a helmet, he tested its capacity for resisting blows, and battered\n",
      "it out of shape; next time he did not test it, but “deemed” it to be\n",
      "a very good helmet. This habit of “deeming” dominated his life. But\n",
      "every refusal to face unpleasant facts is of the same kind: we are all\n",
      "Don Quixotes more or less. Don Quixote would not have done as he did\n",
      "if he had been taught at school to make a really good helmet, and if\n",
      "he had been surrounded by companions who refused to “deem” whatever he\n",
      "wished to believe. The habit of living in fancies is normal and right\n",
      "in early childhood, because young children have an impotence which\n",
      "is not pathological. But as adult life approaches, there must be a\n",
      "more and more vivid realization that dreams are only valuable in so\n",
      "far as they can be translated, sooner or later, into fact. Boys are\n",
      "admirable in correcting the purely personal claims of other boys; in\n",
      "a school, it is difficult to cherish illusions as to one’s power in\n",
      "relation to schoolfellows. But the myth-making faculty remains active\n",
      "in other directions, often with the co-operation of the masters. One’s\n",
      "own school is the best in the world; one’s country is always right and\n",
      "always victorious; one’s social class (if one is rich) is better than\n",
      "any other class. All these are undesirable myths. They lead us to deem\n",
      "that we have a good helmet, when in fact some one else’s sword could\n",
      "cut it in two. In this way they promote laziness and lead ultimately to\n",
      "disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "To cure this habit of mind, it is necessary, as in many other cases,\n",
      "to replace fear by rational prevision of misfortune. Fear makes people\n",
      "unwilling to face real dangers. A person afflicted with subjectivity,\n",
      "if awakened in the middle of the night by the cry of “fire”, might\n",
      "decide that it must be his neighbour’s house, since the truth would be\n",
      "too terrifying; he might thus lose the moment when escape was still\n",
      "possible. This, of course, could only occur in a pathological case; but\n",
      "in politics the analogous behaviour is normal. Fear, as an emotion, is\n",
      "disastrous in all cases where the right course can only be discovered\n",
      "by thinking; we want, therefore, to be able to foresee possibilities of\n",
      "evil without feeling fear, and to use our intelligence for the purpose\n",
      "of avoiding what is not inevitable. Evils which are really inevitable\n",

      "obstacle to truthful thinking. In this sphere, it is much easier to\n",
      "overcome in youth than in later life, because a change of opinion is\n",
      "less likely to bring grave misfortune to a boy or girl than to an\n",

      "they questioned what I regarded as important truths. I should make it\n",
      "my object to teach thinking, not orthodoxy, or even heterodoxy. And I\n",
      "should absolutely never sacrifice intellect to the fancied interest\n",
      "of morals. It is generally held that the teaching of virtue demands\n",
      "the inculcation of falsehood. In politics, we conceal the vices of\n",
      "eminent statesmen of our own party. In theology, we conceal the sins\n",
      "of Popes if we are Catholics, and the sins of Luther and Calvin if we\n",

      "shall seek virtue by the right training of passions and instincts,\n",
      "not by lying and deceit. In the virtue that I desire, the pursuit\n",
      "of knowledge, without fear and without limitation, is an essential\n",
      "element, in the absence of which the rest has little value.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I am saying is no more than this: that I should cultivate the\n",

      "The scientific spirit demands in the first place a wish to find out\n",
      "the truth; the more ardent this wish, the better. It involves, in\n",
      "addition, certain intellectual qualities. There must be preliminary\n",
      "uncertainty, and subsequent decision according to the evidence. We must\n",
      "not imagine in advance that we already know what the evidence will\n",
      "prove. Nor must we be content with a lazy scepticism, which regards\n",
      "objective truth as unattainable and all evidence as inconclusive. We\n",
      "should admit that even our best-founded beliefs probably stand in need\n",
      "of _some_ correction; but truth, so far as it is humanly attainable,\n",
      "is a matter of degree. Our beliefs in physics are certainly less false\n",
      "now than they were before the time of Galileo. Our beliefs as to child\n",
      "psychology are certainly nearer to the truth than Dr. Arnold’s were.\n",
      "In each case, the advance has come through substituting observation\n",
      "for preconceptions and passions. It is for the sake of this step that\n",
      "preliminary uncertainty is so important. It is necessary, therefore,\n",
      "to teach this, and also to teach the skill required for marshalling\n",
      "evidence. In a world where rival propagandists are perpetually blazing\n",
      "falsehoods at us, to induce us to poison ourselves with pills or each\n",
      "other with poison gases, this critical habit of mind is enormously\n",

      "\n",
      "**Persona:**\n",
      "The writer presents an authoritative yet approachable persona. The text is written in a conversational tone, making it accessible and engaging. The writer appears as an expert who is also an explorer, inviting the reader to consider and participate in the educational strategies being discussed.\n",

      "### COHERENCE MECHANISMS\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sentence Linking:**\n",
      "   - **Explicit Connectors:** The text uses explicit connectors like \"But,\" \"And,\" \"As to this,\" \"Similarly,\" \"For this reason,\" \"The one is,\" \"The other is,\" \"When,\" \"This is,\" \"What I should do,\" \"What I am saying,\" \"In this way,\" \"In this sphere,\" \"Throughout the later school years,\" etc.\n",
      "   - **Implied Connectors:** The text also uses implied connections, especially within explanations and examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Given vs. New Information:**\n",
      "   - **Given Information:** The text often starts with given information (e.g., \"Certain subjects, of great utilitarian importance,\" \"More important than the curriculum,\" \"All through education,\" etc.) and then introduces new information.\n",
      "   - **New Information:** New information is introduced in the form of explanations, examples, and recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Subject Consistency:**\n",
      "   - The text maintains subject consistency across sentences, often referring back to the main topic or idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pronoun Reference:**\n",
      "   - **Clear:** The pronoun references are generally clear, with \"they,\" \"it,\" \"he,\" \"she,\" etc., referring back to specific subjects or ideas.\n",
      "   - **Ambiguous:** There are a few instances where the pronoun reference could be ambiguous, but the context usually clarifies it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### LOGICAL PROGRESSION\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sequence:**\n",
      "   - The sequence is primarily **deductive**, moving from general principles to specific examples and recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Premises:**\n",
      "   - **Stated:** Premises are often stated explicitly at the beginning of each paragraph (e.g., \"Certain subjects, of great utilitarian importance, would have to be taught to everybody.\").\n",
      "   - **Assumed:** Some premises are assumed, especially in the explanations and examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Qualifications:**\n",
      "   - Qualifications are positioned within the explanations and examples, often to clarify or limit the scope of the claims (e.g., \"I should say that every pupil ought to know something also about Parliament and the Constitution, but care must be taken to prevent teaching on this subject from degenerating into political propaganda.\").\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logical Gaps:**\n",
      "   - There are minimal logical gaps, as the text generally moves logically from one idea to the next. However, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.\n",
      "\n",
      "### TRANSITIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Within Paragraphs:**\n",
      "   - Transitions within paragraphs are generally smooth, with clear connectors and logical progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Between Paragraphs:**\n",
      "   - Transitions between paragraphs are mostly clear, but some could be smoother. For example, the transition from Paragraph 3 to Paragraph 4 could be more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Connective Tissue vs. Substance:**\n",
      "   - The text has a good balance of connective tissue and substance, with clear explanations and examples supporting the claims.\n",
