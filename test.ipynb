      "_names_ for one man, as we should be if we said \"Scott is Sir Walter.\"\n",
      "A man's name is what he is called, but however much Scott had been\n",
      "called the author of Waverley, that would not have made him be the\n",
      "author; it was necessary for him actually to write Waverley, which was\n",
      "a fact having nothing to do with names.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, then, we are asserting identity of denotation, we must not mean by\n",
      "_denotation_ the mere relation of a name to the thing named. In fact,\n",
      "it would be nearer to the truth to say that the _meaning_ of \"Scott\"\n",
      "is the _denotation_ of \"the author of Waverley.\" The relation of\n",
      "\"Scott\" to Scott is that \"Scott\" means Scott, just as the relation of\n",
      "\"author\" to the concept which is so called is that \"author\" means this\n",
      "concept. Thus if we distinguish meaning and denotation in \"the author\n",
      "of Waverley,\" we shall have to say that \"Scott\" has meaning but not\n",
      "denotation. Also when we say \"Scott is the author of Waverley,\" the\n",
      "_meaning_ of \"the author of Waverley\" is relevant to our assertion.\n",
      "For if the denotation alone were relevant, any other phrase with the\n",
      "same denotation would give the same proposition. Thus \"Scott is the\n",
      "author of Marmion\" would be the same proposition as \"Scott is the\n",
      "author of Waverley.\" But this is plainly not the case, since from the\n",
      "first we learn that Scott wrote Marmion and from the second we learn\n",
      "that he wrote Waverley, but the first tells us nothing about Waverley\n",
      "and the second nothing about Marmion. Hence the meaning of \"the author\n",
      "of Waverley,\" as opposed to the denotation, is certainly relevant to\n",
      "\"Scott is the author of Waverley.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We have thus agreed that \"the author of Waverley\" is not a mere name,\n",
      "and that its meaning is relevant in propositions in which it occurs.\n",
      "Thus if we are to say, as Miss Jones does, that \"Scott is the author\n",
      "of Waverley\" asserts an identity of denotation, we must regard the\n",
      "denotation of \"the author of Waverley\" as the denotation of what is\n",
      "_meant_ by \"the author of Waverley.\" Let us call the meaning of \"the\n",
      "author of Waverley\" M. Thus M is what \"the author of Waverley\" means.\n",
      "Then we are to suppose that \"Scott is the author of Waverley\" means\n",
      "\"Scott is the denotation of M.\" But here we are explaining our\n",
      "proposition by another of the same form, and thus we have made no\n",
      "progress towards a real explanation. \"The denotation of M,\" like \"the\n",
      "author of Waverley,\" has both meaning and denotation, on the theory we\n",
      "are examining. If we call its meaning M', our proposition becomes\n",
      "\"Scott is the denotation of M'.\" But this leads at once to an endless\n",
      "regress. Thus the attempt to regard our proposition as asserting\n",
      "identity of denotation breaks down, and it becomes imperative to find\n",
      "some other analysis. When this analysis has been completed, we shall\n",
      "be able to reinterpret the phrase \"identity of denotation,\" which\n",
      "remains obscure so long as it is taken as fundamental.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first point to observe is that, in any proposition about \"the\n",
      "author of Waverley,\" provided Scott is not explicitly mentioned, the\n",
      "denotation itself, i.e. Scott, does not occur, but only the concept of\n",
      "denotation, which will be represented by a variable. Suppose we say\n",
      "\"the author of Waverley was the author of Marmion,\" we are certainly\n",
      "not saying that both were Scott--we may have forgotten that there was\n",
      "such a person as Scott. We are saying that there is some man who was\n",
      "the author of Waverley and the author of Marmion. That is to say,\n",
      "there is some one who wrote Waverley and Marmion, and no one else\n",
      "wrote them. Thus the identity is that of a variable, i.e. of an\n",
      "indefinite subject, \"some one.\" This is why we can understand\n",
      "propositions about \"the author of Waverley,\" without knowing who he\n",
      "was. When we say \"the author of Waverley was a poet,\" we mean \"one and\n",
      "only one man wrote Waverley, and he was a poet\"; when we say \"the\n",
      "author of Waverley was Scott\" we mean \"one and only one man wrote\n",
      "Waverley, and he was Scott.\" Here the identity is between a variable,\n",
      "i.e. an indeterminate subject (\"he\"), and Scott; \"the author of\n",
      "Waverley\" has been analysed away, and no longer appears as a\n",
      "constituent of the proposition.[48]\n"
