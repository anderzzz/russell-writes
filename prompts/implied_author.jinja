## TASK: IMPLIED AUTHOR CONSTRUCTION

You are analyzing a text to construct a portrait of its **implied author** - the sensibility, personality, and stance that emerges from the prose itself, independent of biographical knowledge.

Your goal is to identify the **mind behind the writing** through evidence visible in the text.

**CRITICAL: AUTHOR ANONYMITY**
- **Never identify or name the author**, even if you recognize their writing style
- Treat the author as anonymous throughout your analysis
- Use only "this author," "the writer," or similar neutral references
- Even if the content or style strongly suggests a particular author, **do not name them**
- The goal is to create a portable analysis method applicable to any author

## ANALYTICAL DIMENSIONS

For each dimension below, ground every observation in **quoted textual evidence**. Do not make claims you cannot anchor in specific passages.

### 1. RELATIONSHIP TO MATERIAL

How does this author hold their subject matter?

- Do they write with curiosity, mastery, struggle, delight, or another stance?
- Are they discovering something and sharing it, thinking aloud, or marshaling evidence for a conclusion?
- How do they handle complexity? Do they relish it, apologize for it, work to dissolve it?

**Quote passages that reveal this relationship.**

### 2. RELATIONSHIP TO READER

Who does the prose imagine its reader to be?

- An equal, a student, a skeptic, a fellow traveler?
- What does the author assume the reader knows? What do they explain?
- Is there intimacy or distance? Private conversation or public address?

**Quote passages that establish this relationship.**

### 3. RELATIONSHIP TO UNCERTAINTY

How does the author handle claims they cannot fully establish?

- Where do they qualify, hedge, or acknowledge alternatives?
- Where do they assert without qualification? What earns that confidence?
- How comfortable are they with provisional conclusions?

**Quote passages showing their stance toward uncertainty.**

### 4. RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACT OF WRITING

Does the author appear to take pleasure in the prose itself, or is language merely instrumental?

- Are there moments of wit, wordplay, or aesthetic satisfaction?
- Is such ornamentation avoided in favor of transparency?
- Does the prose call attention to itself or pursue invisibility?

**Quote passages that reveal this relationship.**

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

For each of the 4 dimensions above:
1. State your observation clearly
2. Quote 2-3 specific passages as evidence
3. Explain what the quoted passages reveal

### PART 2: SIGNATURE MOMENTS

Identify **3-5 passages** where this author's sensibility is most concentrated - where the implied author becomes most vivid.

For each:
- Quote the passage
- Explain what makes it particularly recognizable
- Note which dimensions converge here

### PART 3: SYNTHETIC PORTRAIT

Write a **150-200 word** portrait of this implied author.

Capture their temperament, values, and characteristic way of being in relation to ideas and readers. Write as you would describe a mind you have come to know through its prose.

This portrait should be rich enough that someone reading it could begin to recognize this author in an unsigned passage.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Quote Evidence**: Every observation must be grounded in quoted passages
2. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" or "the writer" (not by name)
3. **Text-Internal**: Base analysis only on what's visible in this text
4. **Specificity**: Avoid generic descriptions ("clear," "engaging") - be precise about *how* and *what*
