INSTRUCTION SET: CROSS-TEXT SYNTHESIS

You have analyzed multiple prose passages. For each passage, you performed a cross-perspective integration, identifying how different analytical lenses interact to create the text's effects.

You now have {{ integrated_analyses|length }} integrated analyses, one per text passage.

Your task is to synthesize these analyses to extract:
1. Recurring patterns across texts
2. Context-dependent variations
3. Hierarchies of importance
4. Generalizable principles

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 0. TECHNIQUE CONSOLIDATION

Before analyzing patterns, consolidate similar techniques that may be named differently:

**Identify Same Technique, Different Names:**
- Sample A: "Simple frames before complexity"
- Sample B: "Anchoring sentences"
- Sample C: "Conceptual staging"
→ CONSOLIDATED: "Simple Anchor Technique" (opening complex ideas with 3-5 word frames)

**For each consolidated technique:**
- List all variations/names found
- Extract the common mechanical specification
- Preserve the best/most complete description
- Collect ALL examples across texts (you'll need these for teaching)

**Consolidation Principles:**
- If mechanical specs match (word counts, positions, structures) = same technique
- If effects are identical but mechanisms differ = related but distinct
- When uncertain, keep separate but note potential relationship

### 1. STABLE PATTERNS

Identify techniques and interactions that appear consistently across multiple texts:

**For each stable pattern:**
- Specify: In how many texts does this appear? (N/[total])
- Describe: What is the pattern? (be precise with mechanical specs)
- **Consolidate magnitude data across texts:**
  - Frequency range: "Appears in 20-35% of sentences (avg 28%)"
  - Classification consensus: "TEXTURAL in all texts" or "STRUCTURAL in 2 texts, TEXTURAL in 1"
  - Distribution patterns: "Uniformly distributed" or "Clustered in paragraph openings across all texts"
  - Prescriptive dosage: Average the frequencies and provide target range
- Collect examples: Gather 3-5 actual sentences/paragraphs that demonstrate this
  - Choose varied examples that show the technique's range
  - Include both simple and complex applications
  - Preserve these verbatim for prescriptive use
- Assess centrality: Is this foundational or secondary?
- Mechanical specification: Consolidate all parameters
  - Word counts, ratios, positions
  - Decision rules (if X then Y)
  - Construction sequence

**Look for patterns in:**
- Specific techniques (e.g., "always uses short opening sentences")
- Domain interactions (e.g., "lexical simplicity enables syntactic complexity")
- Load-bearing features (e.g., "rhythm consistently supports logical flow")
- Rhetorical strategies (e.g., "establishes authority through understated tone")

**Critical:** Each pattern must include consolidated frequency data. If integrated analyses provided magnitude classifications (STRUCTURAL/TEXTURAL/ACCENT), preserve and reconcile them across texts.

### 2. CONTEXTUAL VARIATIONS

Identify where techniques differ based on the text's purpose or subject matter:

**For each variation:**
- Specify the contexts (e.g., "in argumentative texts" vs. "in explanatory texts")
- Describe how the technique adapts
- Quote examples showing the contrast
- Hypothesize: Why might this variation serve different purposes?

**Possible dimensions of variation:**
- Genre or mode (argument, exposition, polemic, narrative)
- Complexity of subject matter (technical vs. accessible topics)
- Intended audience (specialist vs. general reader)
- Emotional temperature (cool analysis vs. passionate advocacy)

### 3. HIERARCHIES OF IMPORTANCE

Determine which features are most fundamental to the overall effect:

**Create a ranked hierarchy:**

**Tier 1: Foundational** (features that enable everything else)
- List 2-4 features
- Evidence: Quote from multiple analyses showing their load-bearing role
- Explain: What would collapse without these?
- **Magnitude expectation**: These should be STRUCTURAL (70-100% presence). If not, explain why.

**Tier 2: Characteristic** (features that create the distinctive quality)
- List 3-6 features
- Evidence: Quote from multiple analyses
- Explain: What makes these recognizable or distinctive?
- **Magnitude expectation**: These are typically TEXTURAL (30-70% presence) or high-end ACCENT features

**Tier 3: Tactical** (features used situationally)
- List 3-6 features
- Evidence: Quote from analyses showing variable deployment
- Explain: When and why are these used?
- **Magnitude expectation**: These are typically ACCENT (5-30%) or ORNAMENTAL (<5%)

**Critical insight:** The hierarchy should correlate with frequency. If a rare feature appears in Tier 1, you must explain why its selective use is foundational (e.g., "Rhetorical questions appear rarely (8%) but always at critical argumentative transitions, making their strategic placement load-bearing").

### 4. CROSS-DOMAIN SYNTHESIS

Identify the most important interactions between analytical domains:

**For each major interaction:**
- Name it: "Lexical simplicity × Syntactic complexity = Accessible density"
- Frequency: How often does this interaction appear?
- Mechanism: HOW does the interaction work?
- Effect: WHAT does it achieve?
- Evidence: Quote from multiple text analyses

**Focus especially on:**
- Interactions that appear foundational (Tier 1)
- Interactions that resolve apparent tensions
- Interactions that multiple text analyses independently identified

### 5. OUTLIER SIGNIFICANCE

Note patterns that appear rarely but seem especially powerful:

- Did any single text do something unique that was highly effective?
- Are there techniques mentioned by only one analyst type that explain effects others struggled with?
- Where did texts achieve excellence through unusual means?

**For each outlier:**
- Describe what's unusual
- Assess whether it's text-specific or potentially generalizable
- Consider: Is this a advanced technique or a contextual adaptation?

### 6. NEGATIVE SPACE

Identify what's consistently ABSENT or AVOIDED:

- What techniques do these texts NOT use?
- Where are typical prose "moves" conspicuously missing?
- What do the analysts consistently NOT critique?

**This reveals:** What makes these texts distinctive may be what they *don't* do.

### 7. TEACHABILITY ASSESSMENT

For each identified pattern/technique:

**Rate Prescriptive Readiness:**
- **READY**: Full mechanical specs + clear examples + decision rules
- **NEARLY READY**: Has specs and examples but needs parameters refined
- **NEEDS WORK**: Effect clear but mechanism needs specification

**Missing Pieces Inventory:**
- What specific parameters still need quantification?
- Which decision rules need clarification?
- What contextual triggers remain vague?

**Example Collection Audit:**
- Do we have 3+ varied examples for major techniques?
- Are examples clear enough to serve as models?
- Do examples cover the range of the technique's application?

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Organize your synthesis as follows:

**I. Stable Core Patterns** (the consistent techniques)
   - List with frequency counts and examples

**II. Contextual Variations** (how techniques adapt)
   - Organized by dimension of variation

**III. Hierarchy of Features** (Tier 1, 2, and 3)
   - Ranked by foundational importance

**IV. Essential Interactions** (the key cross-domain synergies)
   - Named and explained with mechanism

**V. Outliers and Innovations** (rare but powerful techniques)

**VI. Negative Space** (what's notably absent)

**VII. PROVISIONAL PRINCIPLES (toward a prescriptive framework)
    - Transform your findings into proto-instructions:
    - For each major pattern/technique:
      1. Draft prescriptive statement: "To achieve X, do Y"
         - Example: "To maintain clarity in complex arguments, place core claims in 8-12 word independent clauses"
      2. **Specify dosage (CRITICAL for preventing over-stylization):**
         - Include classification: STRUCTURAL/TEXTURAL/ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL
         - Include frequency target: "Use in approximately 25-35% of explanatory sentences"
         - Include distribution guidance: "Concentrate in paragraph openings" or "Distribute uniformly"
         - Example: "TEXTURAL (30-40%). Use in roughly 1 in 3 complex sentences, primarily for technical explanations."
      3. Attach example set: 3-5 model sentences/paragraphs
         - These should work as few-shot learning examples
         - Show the technique clearly without explanation needed
      4. Specify conditions: When to use/not use
      5. Note dependencies: What must come before/after
         - "Requires established credibility first"
         - "Follow with supporting evidence"

**ANTI-AMPLIFICATION CHECK:**
Review each provisional principle. If it lacks frequency/dosage guidance, it will cause over-stylization when applied. Every principle must answer: "How often should this appear?"

## INPUT/OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

**YOU RECEIVE:**
- {{ integrated_analyses|length }} integrated analyses from individual text passages
- Each contains extracted techniques with mechanical specifications
- Each includes concrete examples from its source text

**YOU MUST PRODUCE:**
- Consolidated technique inventory (with duplicates merged)
- Pattern stability assessment (how universal vs. contextual)
- Collected example bank (3-5 instances per major technique)
- Hierarchical organization (foundational → tactical)
- Proto-prescriptive principles (draft instructions with examples)

**CRITICAL:** Your output becomes prescriptive guidance. Therefore:
- Preserve ALL mechanical specifications (counts, ratios, positions)
- Collect concrete examples, not descriptions of examples
- Use memorable technique names that hint at function
- Never reference "Sample X" - only quote actual text
- Output should be ready for conversion to a teaching document


## CRITICAL GUIDELINES
- **Consolidate aggressively**: Same mechanism = same technique (even if named differently)
- **Collect examples obsessively**: You need 3-5 good examples per technique for teaching
- **Preserve specifications exactly**: "8-12 words" not "short"
- **Think like a teacher**: What would someone need to replicate this?
- **No sample references**: Only actual text examples that demonstrate techniques
