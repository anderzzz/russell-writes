INSTRUCTION SET: CROSS-TEXT SYNTHESIS

You have analyzed multiple prose passages. For each passage, you performed a cross-perspective integration, identifying how different analytical lenses interact to create the text's effects.

You now have {{ integrated_analyses|length }} integrated analyses, one per text passage.

Your task is to synthesize these analyses to extract:
1. Recurring patterns across texts
2. Context-dependent variations
3. Hierarchies of importance
4. Generalizable principles

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. STABLE PATTERNS

Identify techniques and interactions that appear consistently across multiple texts:

**For each stable pattern:**
- Specify: In how many texts does this appear? (N/[total])
- Describe: What is the pattern? (be precise)
- Quote: Provide examples from at least 3 different text analyses
- Assess centrality: Is this foundational or secondary?

**Look for patterns in:**
- Specific techniques (e.g., "always uses short opening sentences")
- Domain interactions (e.g., "lexical simplicity enables syntactic complexity")
- Load-bearing features (e.g., "rhythm consistently supports logical flow")
- Rhetorical strategies (e.g., "establishes authority through understated tone")

### 2. CONTEXTUAL VARIATIONS

Identify where techniques differ based on the text's purpose or subject matter:

**For each variation:**
- Specify the contexts (e.g., "in argumentative texts" vs. "in explanatory texts")
- Describe how the technique adapts
- Quote examples showing the contrast
- Hypothesize: Why might this variation serve different purposes?

**Possible dimensions of variation:**
- Genre or mode (argument, exposition, polemic, narrative)
- Complexity of subject matter (technical vs. accessible topics)
- Intended audience (specialist vs. general reader)
- Emotional temperature (cool analysis vs. passionate advocacy)

### 3. HIERARCHIES OF IMPORTANCE

Determine which features are most fundamental to the overall effect:

**Create a ranked hierarchy:**

**Tier 1: Foundational** (features that enable everything else)
- List 2-4 features
- Evidence: Quote from multiple analyses showing their load-bearing role
- Explain: What would collapse without these?

**Tier 2: Characteristic** (features that create the distinctive quality)
- List 3-6 features
- Evidence: Quote from multiple analyses
- Explain: What makes these recognizable or distinctive?

**Tier 3: Tactical** (features used situationally)
- List 3-6 features
- Evidence: Quote from analyses showing variable deployment
- Explain: When and why are these used?

### 4. CROSS-DOMAIN SYNTHESIS

Identify the most important interactions between analytical domains:

**For each major interaction:**
- Name it: "Lexical simplicity × Syntactic complexity = Accessible density"
- Frequency: How often does this interaction appear?
- Mechanism: HOW does the interaction work?
- Effect: WHAT does it achieve?
- Evidence: Quote from multiple text analyses

**Focus especially on:**
- Interactions that appear foundational (Tier 1)
- Interactions that resolve apparent tensions
- Interactions that multiple text analyses independently identified

### 5. OUTLIER SIGNIFICANCE

Note patterns that appear rarely but seem especially powerful:

- Did any single text do something unique that was highly effective?
- Are there techniques mentioned by only one analyst type that explain effects others struggled with?
- Where did texts achieve excellence through unusual means?

**For each outlier:**
- Describe what's unusual
- Assess whether it's text-specific or potentially generalizable
- Consider: Is this a advanced technique or a contextual adaptation?

### 6. NEGATIVE SPACE

Identify what's consistently ABSENT or AVOIDED:

- What techniques do these texts NOT use?
- Where are typical prose "moves" conspicuously missing?
- What do the analysts consistently NOT critique?

**This reveals:** What makes these texts distinctive may be what they *don't* do.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Organize your synthesis as follows:

**I. Stable Core Patterns** (the consistent techniques)
   - List with frequency counts and examples

**II. Contextual Variations** (how techniques adapt)
   - Organized by dimension of variation

**III. Hierarchy of Features** (Tier 1, 2, and 3)
   - Ranked by foundational importance

**IV. Essential Interactions** (the key cross-domain synergies)
   - Named and explained with mechanism

**V. Outliers and Innovations** (rare but powerful techniques)

**VI. Negative Space** (what's notably absent)

**VII. Provisional Principles** (toward a prescriptive framework)
   - Based on the above, what preliminary "rules" emerge?
   - These will be refined by the final Synthesist

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

- **Distinguish frequency from importance**: Something might be rare but crucial
- **Quote liberally**: Ground every claim in specific evidence from the analyses
- **Maintain precision**: Don't blur distinctions in the pursuit of generality
- **Note uncertainty**: If you're unsure whether a pattern is stable, say so
- **Preserve complexity**: Don't oversimplify for the sake of clean categories
- **Track your confidence**: Rate each pattern's robustness (high/medium/low confidence)

Your output should provide a data-driven foundation for the final Synthesist to create actionable prescriptive principles. You are building the empirical base, not yet writing the style guide.
