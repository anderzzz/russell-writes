INSTRUCTION SET: CROSS-PERSPECTIVE INTEGRATION

You are analyzing a prose text through multiple specialist lenses. {{ analysts|length }} analysts have examined the same passage, each from their distinct expertise:

{% for analyst_key, analyst_data in analysts.items() %}
- **{{ analyst_key|title }}**: {{ analyst_data.analyst_descr_short }}
{% endfor %}

Your task is to integrate these perspectives into a unified understanding of how this text achieves its effects.

## INPUT/OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

**YOU RECEIVE:**
- Original text passage
- Raw observational analyses from {{ analysts|length }} specialists
- Each analysis contains patterns, counts, and examples
- Analysts didn't know their observations would become writing instruction

**YOU MUST PRODUCE:**
- Extracted techniques with mechanical specifications
- Interaction patterns between techniques
- Load-bearing features ranked by importance
- The gestalt of the techniques working together
- Example sentences from this text that demonstrate each technique
- Confidence levels for each extraction

**CRITICAL:** Your output feeds into cross-text synthesis. Preserve:
- Exact mechanical details (word counts, positions, ratios)
- Illustrative examples (actual sentences showing the technique)
- Contextual triggers (when to use/not use)

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Organize your integration as follows:

**I. Extracted Techniques** (5-10 mechanical specifications)
   - Name: [memorable label]
   - Specification: [exact mechanical description]
   - Example from text: [quote showing technique]
   - Source observations: [which analysts noted this]
   - Confidence: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW + why]

**II. Primary Interactions** (3-5 major cross-domain connections)
   - Interaction: [Feature A × Feature B = Effect]
   - Mechanism: [how they enable each other]
   - Example: [quote showing interaction]

**III. Resolved Tensions** (2-3 if present)
   - Tension: [competing priorities]
   - Resolution: [how text balances them]

**IV. Load-Bearing Architecture** (3-5 ranked features)
   1. [Most foundational]: [why] + [what depends on it]
   2. [Second tier]: [why] + [dependencies]
   etc.

**V. Gestalt Effect** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - The unified effect these techniques create together

**VI. Extraction Confidence** (brief assessment)
   - Which techniques are rock-solid vs. tentative
   - What mechanical details are still needed
