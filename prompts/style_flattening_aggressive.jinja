Extract the propositional content of the following text as a compressed outline.

Your goal: Strip away ALL stylistic elements and reduce the text to its bare logical skeleton. Aim for 30-50% of the original length.

## Format

Use telegraphic language organized as a hierarchical outline:

```
- CLAIM: [Core assertion in minimal words]
  - Evidence/Support: [Key facts/examples]
  - Qualification: [Caveats, limitations, nuances]
  - Implication: [What follows from this]

- CLAIM: [Next assertion]
  ...
```

## Rules

1. **No full sentences** - Use fragments and phrases only
2. **No transitions** - Strip all connective tissue (however, therefore, moreover, etc.)
3. **No rhetoric** - Remove all persuasive devices, emphasis, tone markers
4. **Bare logic only** - Preserve argument structure, not prose structure
5. **Telegraphic style** - Like taking notes for yourself, not writing for others
6. **Radical compression** - If it doesn't contribute to the logical skeleton, delete it

## What to Preserve

- Core claims and assertions
- Supporting evidence and examples
- Logical relationships (if X then Y, but not the rhetorical packaging)
- Qualifications and caveats that affect truth conditions
- Distinctions and contrasts that matter for the argument

## What to Remove

- All stylistic word choices (replace with neutral equivalents)
- Sentence structure and rhythm
- Transitional phrases and signposting
- Rhetorical questions, metaphors, analogies (keep only the underlying point)
- Repetition for emphasis
- Examples used for illustration (keep only examples that provide evidence)

**Think of this as creating a skeletal outline that someone could use to rebuild the argument's logic, but with completely different style and prose.**
