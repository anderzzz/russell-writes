ANALYTICAL FOCUS: DENSITY AND ECONOMY PATTERNS

For the provided text, document:
{% set counter = namespace(value=0) %}
{% if include_word_economy %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. WORD ECONOMY PATTERNS
   - What is the degree of verbal economy? (sparse/moderate/generous/abundant)
   - Where does redundancy appear and what effect does it create?
   - Word length patterns: short/long, Anglo-Saxon/Latinate ratios
   - Frequency and placement of modifiers (adjectives/adverbs)
{% endif %}
{% if include_structural_efficiency %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. STRUCTURAL DENSITY
   - Sentence complexity distribution: simple vs. compound vs. complex
   - Clause density: how much subordination per sentence?
   - Voice patterns: where does passive appear and to what effect?
   - Formal vs. conversational phrasing: register consistency
{% endif %}
{% if include_density_analysis %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. INFORMATION DENSITY
   - Information load per sentence (high/medium/low)
   - Ratio of semantic content to grammatical scaffolding
   - Where does prose expand vs. compress?
   - Presence and function of elaborative phrases
{% endif %}
{% if include_subtraction_test %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. SEMANTIC LOAD DISTRIBUTION
   - Role of modifiers: descriptive/emphatic/rhetorical?
   - Which words carry primary semantic weight?
   - How is meaning distributed across syntax?
   - What stylistic effects depend on elaboration vs. compression?
