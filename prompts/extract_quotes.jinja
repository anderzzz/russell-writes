## TASK SPECIFICATION

Extract all quotes from the original text that appear in this analysis.

For each quote:
1. **Extract the exact quoted text** (typically 1-3 sentences, but may be longer)
2. **Classify its context_type** based on why it was quoted:
   - `signature_moment`: From "SIGNATURE MOMENTS" or similar sections highlighting characteristic passages
   - `high_density_decision`: From decision pattern analysis showing multiple craft choices converging
   - `textural_exemplar`: From functional texture analysis highlighting distinctive style features
   - `evidence_quote`: Supporting evidence for dimensional analysis or claims
3. **Note the rationale**: Why was this passage highlighted in the analysis?

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "analysis_type": "{{ analysis_type }}",
  "quotes": [
    {
      "quote_text": "The exact quoted passage from the original text...",
      "context_type": "signature_moment",
      "rationale": "Brief explanation of why this was highlighted"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Valid context_type values:**
- `signature_moment`
- `high_density_decision`
- `textural_exemplar`
- `evidence_quote`

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Extract ONLY quotes that appear in the analysis** - Do not invent new quotes or paraphrase
2. **Preserve quote text EXACTLY** - Copy the quoted text character-for-character as it appears
3. **Focus on substantial quotes** - Minimum 1-3 sentences; skip short phrase-level quotes unless they're the only substantial quotes available
4. **Maximum 10 quotes per analysis** - If more than 10 quotes appear, prioritize the most significant ones
5. **Include rationale** - Briefly explain why each quote was highlighted (10-50 words)
6. **Return valid JSON only** - No additional text, no markdown code blocks, just raw JSON

## QUOTE SELECTION PRIORITY

If the analysis contains more than 10 quotes, prioritize:
1. Quotes from dedicated "high-density" or "signature" sections
2. Quotes used as primary examples (not just supporting evidence)
3. Longer, more substantial passages over sentence fragments
4. Quotes with explicit analytical commentary
