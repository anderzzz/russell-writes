## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

- **Be specific**: Always quote the analysts you're synthesizing
- **Show mechanism**: Explain HOW interactions work, not just that they exist
- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't just repeat what individual analysts said
- **Maintain skepticism**: Don't force interactions that aren't there
- **Preserve nuance**: If the text works differently in different sections, note that

Your output should provide a coherent theory of how THIS PARTICULAR TEXT achieves its effects through the interaction of multiple techniques.
