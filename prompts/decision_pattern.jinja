## TASK: DECISION PATTERN ANALYSIS

You are analyzing a text to understand the **compositional decisions** its author made. Every text is the result of countless choices - how to begin, how to structure, when to exemplify, when to abstract, how to handle transitions, when to be brief and when to elaborate.

Your task is to make these decisions **visible** by reconstructing the author's reasoning.

---

## ANALYTICAL APPROACH

Examine the text **sequentially**, identifying moments where the author faced a genuine choice - where a competent writer might plausibly have done otherwise.

Focus on **non-trivial decisions** where the choice reveals something about the author's priorities or craft.

---

## DECISION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

For each major paragraph or section, identify key compositional decisions:

### THE COMPOSITIONAL PROBLEM
What task was the author facing at this moment?

Examples:
- Introducing a complex concept for the first time
- Handling a likely objection or alternative view
- Transitioning between major topics
- Making an abstract idea concrete
- Building toward a conclusion
- Establishing credibility or authority

### THE CHOICE MADE
What did the author actually do? Describe the solution concretely.

**Quote the relevant passage** to show the choice in action.

### ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE
What else might they have done?

What would a more conventional or obvious approach have looked like? (Brief - 1-2 sentences)

### WHAT THE CHOICE ACHIEVES
Why does this solution work?

What does it accomplish that the alternatives would not? What does it prioritize or sacrifice?

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: SEQUENTIAL DECISION ANALYSIS

Work through the text in order, analyzing **5-8 significant decisions**.

For each decision:
```
DECISION #: [Brief label]
Problem: [What task faced]
Choice: [What was done - with quote]
Alternatives: [What else was available]
Achievement: [Why this works]
```

### PART 2: RECURRING PATTERNS

After analyzing individual decisions, identify **patterns**:

- What decision patterns appear multiple times?
- Where does the author seem to have **characteristic moves** - default solutions they reach for when facing certain types of problems?
- Are there problem types this author handles consistently in a particular way?

List 3-5 recurring patterns with examples.

### PART 3: HIGH-DENSITY PASSAGES

Flag **2-4 passages** where multiple significant decisions converge - where the author is solving several compositional problems simultaneously and doing so in characteristic ways.

For each:
- Quote the passage
- List the decisions visible here
- Explain why this passage is particularly dense with craft

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Quote Evidence**: Show each decision through quoted passages
2. **Focus on Why**: Not just "what was done" but "why it works"
3. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" or "the writer"
4. **Avoid Jargon**: Describe choices in plain language accessible to any reader
5. **Selectivity**: Analyze significant decisions, not every sentence choice
