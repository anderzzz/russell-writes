## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. TECHNIQUE IDENTIFICATION AND SPECIFICATION

For each effective pattern observed by the analysts:

**A. Extract the Mechanical Technique**
- What EXACTLY is being done? (Not "clear writing" but "main claims in independent clauses")
- Quantify parameters where possible:
  - Lengths (word counts, syllable counts)
  - Positions (word N of M, start/middle/end)
  - Ratios (main to subordinate, content to scaffolding)
  - Frequencies (per sentence, per paragraph)
- Describe the construction recipe: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3
- Include decision points: "If X, then Y; otherwise Z"

**B. Source the Observation**
- Which analyst(s) identified this?
- Quote their specific observations
- Note if multiple analysts saw it from different angles

**C. Specify Operating Conditions**
- When does this technique appear?
- What triggers its use vs. non-use?
- Are there contextual dependencies?

**Example extraction:**
Syntactician: "Main clauses consistently 8-12 words, subordinates 15-20"
Efficiency Auditor: "Core claims never buried in qualification"
→ TECHNIQUE: "Place core claims in 8-12 word independent clauses. Relegate qualifications to subordinate clauses of 15-20 words following the main assertion."

### 2. INTERACTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

Identify where observations from different domains reinforce or enable each other.

**Consider questions such as:**

- Does syntactic structure create space for lexical precision?
- Does rhythm support or undermine logical flow?
- Does economy in one domain permit complexity in another?
- How do sound patterns affect rhetorical impact?

**For each interaction you identify:**
- Quote specific observations from the relevant analysts
- Explain the mechanism: HOW does feature X enable or affect feature Y?
- Assess the strength: Is this central or peripheral to the text's effect?

### 3. APPARENT TENSIONS OR TRADE-OFFS

Note where different analytical perspectives might suggest conflicting priorities:

- Complexity vs. clarity
- Efficiency vs. rhythm
- Logical rigor vs. rhetorical warmth
- Formal precision vs. conversational ease

**For each tension:**
- Identify the competing values
- Describe how the text navigates or resolves the tension
- Does it favor one side, or achieve genuine balance?

### 4. LOAD-BEARING FEATURES

Determine which features are foundational vs. decorative:

- If you removed feature X, what else would fail?
- Which techniques are the "key tricks" that enable multiple effects?
- What's the hierarchy: which features depend on which others?

**Provide:**
- A ranked list of 3-5 most critical features
- Explanation of why each is load-bearing
- Evidence from multiple analyst perspectives

### 5. THE GESTALT

Step back and describe the overall effect that emerges from the combination:

- What is this text *doing* (arguing, explaining, persuading, clarifying)?
- How do the identified features work together to achieve that purpose?
- Is there something created by the combination that no single perspective captures?
- What's the dominant quality: precision? momentum? accessibility? authority?

### 6. RECONSTRUCTION READINESS

Assess whether we have enough mechanical detail to teach these techniques:

**Teachability Audit:**
- Which techniques could someone replicate immediately?
- Which need more specific parameters?
- Which are clear in effect but unclear in method?

**Missing Specifications:**
- What measurements/counts would help?
- What decision rules need clarification?
- What contextual triggers remain vague?

**This determines:** Whether the technique is ready for prescriptive use or needs more analysis.
