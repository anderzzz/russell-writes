## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. TECHNIQUE IDENTIFICATION AND SPECIFICATION

For each effective pattern observed by the analysts:

**A. Extract the Mechanical Technique**
- What EXACTLY is being done? (Not "clear writing" but "main claims in independent clauses")
- Quantify parameters where possible:
  - Lengths (word counts, syllable counts)
  - Positions (word N of M, start/middle/end)
  - Ratios (main to subordinate, content to scaffolding)
  - Frequencies (per sentence, per paragraph)
- Describe the construction recipe: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3
- Include decision points: "If X, then Y; otherwise Z"

**B. Source the Observation**
- Which analyst(s) identified this?
- Quote their specific observations
- Note if multiple analysts saw it from different angles

**C. Specify Operating Conditions**
- When does this technique appear?
- What triggers its use vs. non-use?
- Are there contextual dependencies?

**Example extraction:**
Syntactician: "Main clauses consistently 8-12 words, subordinates 15-20"
Efficiency Auditor: "Core claims never buried in qualification"
→ TECHNIQUE: "Place core claims in 8-12 word independent clauses. Relegate qualifications to subordinate clauses of 15-20 words following the main assertion."

### 2. MAGNITUDE AND FREQUENCY ANALYSIS

**CRITICAL:** Features identified by analysts exist on a spectrum. An occasional rhetorical flourish, if extracted without frequency data, becomes overused when applied prescriptively. You must quantify magnitude to prevent amplification.

For each technique identified in Section 1, measure its actual presence in the text:

**A. Frequency Quantification**

Count actual occurrences and express as both absolute and relative:
- "Rhetorical questions appear 2 times across 15 sentences (13%)"
- "Semicolon-connected clauses: 3 of 15 sentences (20%)"
- "Metaphorical language: 1 instance per 8 sentences average (12%)"
- "Parenthetical asides: 5 instances across 3 paragraphs (concentrated, not uniform)"

**B. Intensity Measurement**

When a feature appears, how pronounced is it?
- Modifiers: "Modified nouns average 1.2 modifiers; rarely stacked beyond 2"
- Clause complexity: "Complex sentences average 2.3 subordinate clauses; never exceed 4"
- Formal register: "Latinate polysyllables appear in 15% of content words"

**C. Distribution Pattern**

Where and how does the feature appear?
- **Uniform**: "Present consistently throughout (no clustering)"
- **Clustered**: "Concentrated in paragraph openings (4 of 5 paragraphs start with this)"
- **Strategic**: "Appears only at argumentative turning points (3 instances, all after counterargument)"
- **Context-dependent**: "Used in explanatory passages but avoided in polemical ones"

**D. Structural vs. Textural vs. Accent Classification**

Classify each feature by its role in the prose architecture:

**STRUCTURAL** (70-100% presence - defines the baseline)
- These are the default patterns, the constant background
- Example: "Simple subject-verb-object sentences: 75% of all sentences"
- Example: "Anglo-Saxon monosyllables for core concepts: 80% of key terms"
- **Prescriptive implication:** "This is your default mode - use it unless you have a reason to vary"

**TEXTURAL** (30-70% presence - creates characteristic feel)
- These appear regularly enough to shape the prose's texture
- Example: "Subordinate clauses for qualification: 45% of sentences"
- Example: "Technical terms with immediate plain-English paraphrase: 40% of technical vocabulary"
- **Prescriptive implication:** "Use this frequently to establish the characteristic style"

**ACCENT** (5-30% presence - provides contrast and emphasis)
- These are occasional moves that create effect precisely because they're rare
- Example: "Periodic sentences with delayed main clause: 8% of complex sentences"
- Example: "Metaphorical language: 12% of sentences"
- Example: "Direct address to reader ('Consider...' 'Notice...'): 3 instances in 50 sentences (6%)"
- **Prescriptive implication:** "Reserve this for specific moments - overuse destroys the effect"

**ORNAMENTAL** (<5% presence - rare flourishes)
- Exceptional moves that appear once or twice for special effect
- Example: "Alliterative phrasing: 2 instances in entire passage"
- Example: "Rhetorical question: 1 instance, at crucial transition"
- **Prescriptive implication:** "Use sparingly if at all - this is not characteristic"

**E. Dosage Guidance for Reconstruction**

For each technique, provide explicit prescriptive frequency:
- **If STRUCTURAL**: "Default mode - aim for 70-80% of relevant contexts"
- **If TEXTURAL**: "Use frequently - aim for 40-60% of relevant contexts"
- **If ACCENT**: "Use selectively - aim for 10-20% of relevant contexts, at high-impact moments"
- **If ORNAMENTAL**: "Optional flavor - 0-5%, only if it serves clear purpose"

**Example complete analysis:**
```
TECHNIQUE: Parenthetical clarification with em-dashes
FREQUENCY: 5 instances across 15 sentences (33%)
INTENSITY: Always single insertion, 3-8 words, never nested
DISTRIBUTION: Concentrated in complex explanatory passages (5 of 7 complex sentences)
CLASSIFICATION: TEXTURAL (appears in 1/3 of sentences, mostly in specific context)
DOSAGE: Use in 25-35% of complex explanatory sentences; avoid in simple declarative passages
```

**Why this matters:**
Without magnitude data, "the author uses parenthetical asides" becomes "use parenthetical asides" without bounds. With magnitude data, it becomes "use parenthetical asides in roughly 1 in 3 complex sentences, primarily when explaining technical concepts." The second is teachable and won't lead to over-stylization.

### 3. INTERACTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

Identify where observations from different domains reinforce or enable each other.

**Consider questions such as:**

- Does syntactic structure create space for lexical precision?
- Does rhythm support or undermine logical flow?
- Does economy in one domain permit complexity in another?
- How do sound patterns affect rhetorical impact?

**For each interaction you identify:**
- Quote specific observations from the relevant analysts
- Explain the mechanism: HOW does feature X enable or affect feature Y?
- Assess the strength: Is this central or peripheral to the text's effect?
- **Include magnitude data**: Note the frequencies of both interacting features

**Example:**
"Lexical simplicity (STRUCTURAL: 80% Anglo-Saxon monosyllables) creates cognitive space for syntactic complexity (TEXTURAL: 40% multi-clause sentences). This interaction is load-bearing: without the plain vocabulary, the complex syntax would be impenetrable."

### 4. APPARENT TENSIONS OR TRADE-OFFS

Note where different analytical perspectives might suggest conflicting priorities:

- Complexity vs. clarity
- Efficiency vs. rhythm
- Logical rigor vs. rhetorical warmth
- Formal precision vs. conversational ease

**For each tension:**
- Identify the competing values
- Describe how the text navigates or resolves the tension
- Does it favor one side, or achieve genuine balance?
- **Note frequency patterns**: Does the text heavily favor one side (80/20 split) or maintain genuine balance (50/50)?

### 5. LOAD-BEARING FEATURES

Determine which features are foundational vs. decorative:

- If you removed feature X, what else would fail?
- Which techniques are the "key tricks" that enable multiple effects?
- What's the hierarchy: which features depend on which others?

**Provide:**
- A ranked list of 3-5 most critical features
- Explanation of why each is load-bearing
- Evidence from multiple analyst perspectives
- **Magnitude classification**: Are these STRUCTURAL (high-frequency baseline) or TEXTURAL (characteristic patterns)?

**Note:** Load-bearing features are almost always STRUCTURAL (70%+ frequency). If a rare ACCENT feature seems load-bearing, explain why its selective use is critical.

### 6. THE GESTALT

Step back and describe the overall effect that emerges from the combination:

- What is this text *doing* (arguing, explaining, persuading, clarifying)?
- How do the identified features work together to achieve that purpose?
- Is there something created by the combination that no single perspective captures?
- What's the dominant quality: precision? momentum? accessibility? authority?
- **Describe the frequency architecture**: What creates the baseline (STRUCTURAL), what adds texture (TEXTURAL), what provides accent (ACCENT)?

### 7. RECONSTRUCTION READINESS

Assess whether we have enough mechanical detail to teach these techniques:

**Teachability Audit:**
- Which techniques could someone replicate immediately?
- Which need more specific parameters?
- Which are clear in effect but unclear in method?

**Missing Specifications:**
- What measurements/counts would help?
- What decision rules need clarification?
- What contextual triggers remain vague?

**Magnitude Completeness:**
- Have you provided frequency data (%) for each technique?
- Have you classified each as STRUCTURAL/TEXTURAL/ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL?
- Have you specified dosage guidance for prescriptive use?
- Are distribution patterns documented (uniform/clustered/strategic)?

**Critical for preventing over-stylization:**
Each technique must include:
1. Absolute frequency (N occurrences)
2. Relative frequency (% of relevant contexts)
3. Classification (STRUCTURAL/TEXTURAL/ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL)
4. Prescriptive dosage ("aim for X%")
5. Distribution pattern (uniform/clustered/strategic)

**This determines:** Whether the technique is ready for prescriptive use or needs more analysis.
