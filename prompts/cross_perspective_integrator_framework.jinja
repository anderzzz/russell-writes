## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. INTERACTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES

Identify where observations from different domains reinforce or enable each other.

**Consider questions such as:**

- Does syntactic structure create space for lexical precision?
- Does rhythm support or undermine logical flow?
- Does economy in one domain permit complexity in another?
- How do sound patterns affect rhetorical impact?

**For each interaction you identify:**
- Quote specific observations from the relevant analysts
- Explain the mechanism: HOW does feature X enable or affect feature Y?
- Assess the strength: Is this central or peripheral to the text's effect?

### 2. APPARENT TENSIONS OR TRADE-OFFS

Note where different analytical perspectives might suggest conflicting priorities:

- Complexity vs. clarity
- Efficiency vs. rhythm
- Logical rigor vs. rhetorical warmth
- Formal precision vs. conversational ease

**For each tension:**
- Identify the competing values
- Describe how the text navigates or resolves the tension
- Does it favor one side, or achieve genuine balance?

### 3. LOAD-BEARING FEATURES

Determine which features are foundational vs. decorative:

- If you removed feature X, what else would fail?
- Which techniques are the "key tricks" that enable multiple effects?
- What's the hierarchy: which features depend on which others?

**Provide:**
- A ranked list of 3-5 most critical features
- Explanation of why each is load-bearing
- Evidence from multiple analyst perspectives

### 4. THE GESTALT

Step back and describe the overall effect that emerges from the combination:

- What is this text *doing* (arguing, explaining, persuading, clarifying)?
- How do the identified features work together to achieve that purpose?
- Is there something created by the combination that no single perspective captures?
- What's the dominant quality: precision? momentum? accessibility? authority?

### 5. UNEXPLAINED EFFECTIVENESS

Note any observations where analysts seem surprised or struggle to account for excellence:

- Did anyone say "this shouldn't work this well"?
- Are there effects that multiple analysts noticed but couldn't fully explain?
- Where did the text exceed expectations given the technical features?

**This may indicate:** Hidden mechanisms that need further investigation.
