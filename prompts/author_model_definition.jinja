## TASK: AUTHOR MODEL DEFINITION

You are integrating **three synthesized analyses** into a unified **Author Model Definition** that will enable an LLM to generate text in this author's characteristic style.

This definition serves one purpose: **provide sufficient instruction and exemplars for an LLM to write as this author would**.

---

## INPUT

You have three Stage 2 syntheses:

1. **Implied Author Synthesis**: The sensibility dimension
2. **Decision Pattern Synthesis**: The craft dimension
3. **Textural Synthesis**: The formal dimension

Your task: Integrate these into a **self-contained generative model** with prescriptive guidelines and contextualized few-shot examples.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: UNIFIED AUTHOR MODEL (500-700 words)

Write an integrated description of **how this author writes** that synthesizes all three dimensions into actionable guidance.

This is not descriptive—it's **prescriptive**. Write as instructions for *how to write* in this style:

**Fundamental Approach**
- What is this author fundamentally doing when they write? (Arguing, explaining, discovering, persuading, clarifying?)
- What stance should the writer take toward their material?
- What relationship should be established with the reader?
- What is the dominant quality to achieve: precision? momentum? accessibility? authority? Something else?

**Integration of Dimensions**
Show how sensibility, decisions, and texture work together:
- How does the author's sensibility manifest in compositional choices?
- How are those decisions realized in sentence structure, word choice, paragraph shape?
- What emerges from the integration that no single dimension captures?

**Writing Priorities**
- What does this author consistently prioritize? (Clarity over elegance? Nuance over simplicity?)
- What does this author consistently avoid or subordinate?

Write this as **direct instruction** to a language model that will generate text. Use imperatives: "Establish X relationship with the reader. Construct sentences that... Choose words that..."

### PART 2: GENERATIVE GUIDELINES

Translate the synthesis patterns into **specific, actionable writing instructions** organized by compositional task.

For each guideline, specify:
- **WHEN**: Under what conditions this technique applies
- **HOW**: Specific compositional moves to execute
- **WHY**: What this achieves (effect on reader, function in argument)
- **EXAMPLE**: Brief reference to exemplar passages (to be detailed in Part 3)

**A. SENSIBILITY GUIDELINES** (4-6 instructions)
How to enact this author's characteristic stance and relationship to material/reader.

Example format:
```
**Qualified Authority**
WHEN: Asserting core claims
HOW: State the claim firmly in main clause, then immediately acknowledge limits or complications in subordinate clause
WHY: Establishes authority while signaling intellectual honesty; positions reader as capable of nuanced thinking
EXAMPLE: See Exemplar 1, Exemplar 4
```

**B. DECISION GUIDELINES** (6-8 instructions)
How to make compositional choices for recurring problems.

Cover key compositional tasks identified in decision synthesis:
- Opening a text or major section
- Introducing complex concepts
- Transitioning between topics
- Handling objections or alternative views
- Building multi-paragraph arguments
- Concluding sections

**C. TEXTURAL GUIDELINES** (4-6 instructions)
How to construct sentences, choose words, and shape paragraphs.

Address:
- Sentence architecture (complexity management, subordination patterns)
- Lexical choices (register, precision-accessibility balance, verb/noun preferences)
- Paragraph structure (opening moves, development patterns, closing moves)
- Rhythmic variation (when to speed up, slow down, create emphasis)

### PART 3: FEW-SHOT EXEMPLARS

Curate **8-12 exemplary passages** from the syntheses that demonstrate this author's characteristic style in action.

For each exemplar:

```
**EXEMPLAR [N]: [Functional Label]**

**PASSAGE**:
[Full quoted passage - preserve exact text]

**WHAT MAKES THIS CHARACTERISTIC**:
[2-3 paragraphs explaining which sensibility/decision/textural elements converge here]

Annotate specifically:
- Sensibility: What stance/relationship is enacted?
- Decisions: Which compositional choices are demonstrated?
- Texture: What sentence/lexical/paragraph features are present?
- Integration: How do the dimensions work together?

**WHEN TO DEPLOY THIS PATTERN**:
[Under what compositional conditions would this passage serve as a model?]
```

**Selection criteria** for exemplars:
1. **Density**: Multiple characteristic features converge
2. **Diversity**: Collectively cover range of compositional tasks (opening, explaining, arguing, concluding, etc.)
3. **Clarity**: The characteristic features are clearly visible, not subtle
4. **Teachability**: Each exemplar demonstrates something distinct and reusable

**Sources for exemplars**: Draw from passages flagged in the three syntheses:
- Signature moments (from implied author synthesis)
- High-density decision passages (from decision pattern synthesis)
- Texturally distinctive passages (from textural synthesis)
- Exemplary sentences/paragraphs cited in syntheses

**Organization**: Group exemplars by function if helpful (e.g., "Opening Moves", "Handling Complexity", "Textural Integration"), or present sequentially with clear functional labels.

### PART 4: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

Provide **practical notes** for applying this model:

**A. INTENSITY MODULATION**
- When to intensify characteristic features (high-stakes arguments, paradigmatic demonstrations)
- When to moderate them (introductory material, transitions)
- How to avoid caricature or over-application

**B. COMMON PITFALLS**
- What this style is NOT (misconceptions to avoid)
- Anti-patterns: moves this author consistently avoids
- Edge cases: situations where the model might not apply

**C. INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES**
- How do sensibility, decisions, and texture reinforce each other?
- What breaks if one dimension is present but others are absent?
- How to maintain coherence when deploying multiple techniques

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Prescriptive, Not Descriptive**: Write as instructions for generation, not descriptions for recognition
2. **Exemplars as Teachers**: Part 3 exemplars must be full passages with detailed annotations, not just citations
3. **Actionable Specificity**: Every guideline must be concrete enough to execute
4. **Integration**: Show how dimensions work together throughout
5. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" throughout
6. **Completeness**: The output should be self-contained—usable without referring back to the syntheses
