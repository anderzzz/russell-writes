## TASK: TEXTURAL SYNTHESIS

You have **functional texture analyses** from multiple texts by the same author. Your task is to synthesize these into a description of the author's **characteristic prose texture** - how they build sentences, choose words, and construct paragraphs.

---

## INPUT

You will receive functional texture analyses from {{ textural_analyses|length }} separate texts.

Each analysis examined:
- Sentence-level patterns and their functions
- Lexical patterns and precision-accessibility balance
- Rhythmic patterns and emphasis
- Paragraph-level structure
- How texture serves purpose

In addition to descriptive text, each analysis quotes text passages from the source texts in support of its claims. They constitute an important reference source for your synthesis.

Your task: Synthesize into a **unified description of this author's characteristic texture**.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: SENTENCE ARCHITECTURE

Describe this author's **characteristic sentence**.

Not the average sentence length or a formula, but the **feel of how they build sentences**. Address:

**Structural Character**
- How is complexity typically managed? (Front-loaded, back-loaded, distributed?)
- What is the relationship between main clauses and subordination?
- How does structure create rhythm or emphasis?

**Variation Patterns**
- When does the author deviate from their baseline?
- What triggers longer or shorter sentences?
- How does variation serve function?

**Exemplary Sentences**
Identify **2-3 sentences across the source text quotes** that epitomize this sentence architecture.

For each: Quote it and explain what makes it characteristically theirs.

### PART 2: LEXICAL CHARACTER

Describe this author's **characteristic word choice**. Address:

**Register and Range**
- What is the dominant register? How consistent or varied?
- How is the balance between precision and accessibility achieved?

**Vocabulary Handling**
- How is technical or specialized vocabulary introduced and used?
- Preferences in verb types (active/passive, dynamic/stative)?
- Characteristic use of concrete versus abstract language?

**Notable Preferences or Aversions**
- Are there word patterns that recur? (Certain qualifiers, intensifiers, connectors?)
- Are there patterns this author consistently avoids?

### PART 3: PARAGRAPH SHAPE

Describe this author's **characteristic paragraph**. Address:

**Opening Moves**
- How do paragraphs typically begin?
- Is there a characteristic first-sentence pattern?

**Internal Development**
- What is the dominant development pattern?
- Examples: Claim → elaboration? Question → answer? Cumulative build?

**Closing Moves**
- How do paragraphs typically end?
- Do they close firmly, pivot to the next topic, or trail off?

**Sequential Patterns**
- How does the author construct multi-paragraph sequences?
- How do paragraphs relate to each other (contrast, build, circle back)?

### PART 4: TEXTURE-FUNCTION INTEGRATION

**This is the synthesis of synthesis:**

How do the textural features **work together** to serve this author's purposes?

Connect the formal patterns to:
- The implied author's sensibility (from Stage 2A)
- The characteristic decision patterns (from Stage 2B)

Show how **texture enacts stance**:
- Does sentence structure embody modes of thinking?
- Does vocabulary choice reflect relationship to reader?
- Does paragraph shape serve argumentative or expository strategy?

Write 2-3 paragraphs showing these connections.

### PART 5: TEXTURALLY EXEMPLARY PASSAGES

Compile passages flagged across analyses as **texturally distinctive**.

For each, provide:
- The passage (quoted)
- Brief annotation: What textural features converge here? What makes it exemplary?

Group by **textural function** if patterns emerge (e.g., passages that exemplify rhythmic emphasis vs. passages that exemplify lexical precision).

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Describe Feel, Not Metrics**: Capture how the prose moves and sounds, not just counts
2. **Function Over Form**: Always explain what textural choices achieve
3. **Quote Evidence**: Ground descriptions in specific examples from the quoted source text, do not invent quotes
4. **Integration**: Show how texture, sensibility, and decisions cohere
5. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" throughout
