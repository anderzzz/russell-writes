## TASK: PASSAGE EVALUATION FOR FEW-SHOT SUITABILITY

You are evaluating a passage to determine its **suitability as a few-shot example** for teaching an AI to write in this author's manner.

The evaluation uses the **field guide** (recognition criteria and density rubric) constructed from analyzing multiple texts by this author.

**CRITICAL: AUTHOR ANONYMITY**
- **Never identify or name the author** during evaluation, even if the passage is highly recognizable
- Use only "this author," "the writer," or similar neutral references
- Focus on evaluating characteristic features, not on identifying who wrote the text

---

## EVALUATION PRINCIPLE

A good few-shot example is **densely characteristic** - it exhibits this author's sensibility, decision patterns, and textural features in concentrated form.

You're not evaluating quality or correctness. You're evaluating **density of recognizable authorial presence**.

## EVALUATION PROCEDURE

### STEP 1: RECOGNITION CRITERIA ASSESSMENT

Work through the **recognition criteria from the field guide** systematically.

For each category (Sensibility, Decisions, Texture, Integration), assess whether and how strongly the passage exhibits the relevant markers.

**For each marker category:**

1. List the specific criteria (from field guide)
2. Quote moments from the passage that demonstrate presence/absence
3. Assess strength: **STRONG** / **MODERATE** / **WEAK** / **ABSENT**

Example format:
```
CATEGORY: Sensibility Markers
Criterion: "Does prose position reader as equal capable of following complex reasoning?"
Evidence: [quote from passage]
Assessment: STRONG - Reader assumed to grasp abstract concepts without over-explanation

Criterion: [next criterion]
...
```

Work through **all four categories**: Sensibility, Decisions, Texture, Integration.

### STEP 2: DENSITY RATING

Using the **rubric from the field guide**, assign a density rating **1-5**.

Reference the rubric's criteria for each level and explain which level this passage reaches:

**Your Rating: [1/2/3/4/5]**

**Justification:**
- Which qualities from the rubric are present?
- Which are absent or weak?
- Why this rating and not higher/lower?

(2-3 paragraphs grounding your rating in the rubric's specific criteria)

### STEP 3: COMPOSITIONAL TASK COVERAGE

What **compositional tasks** does this passage demonstrate?

Identify which of the author's characteristic decision patterns are visible here:
- Introducing complex concepts?
- Handling objections?
- Transitioning between topics?
- Making abstractions concrete?
- Building arguments?
- Other tasks identified in field guide?

List tasks demonstrated and briefly note how (with quotes).

This matters for **example set diversity** - we want sets that cover different compositional challenges.

### STEP 4: TEACHING VALUE ASSESSMENT

Beyond density, assess **pedagogical value**:

**Self-Containment**
- Can this passage be understood without extensive surrounding context?
- Or does it depend heavily on what comes before/after?

**Topic Generality**
- Is the subject matter specific enough to show technique but general enough to transfer?
- Or is it so specialized it might contaminate generation on other topics?

**Transferability**
- Are the qualities present here **teachable** - could an AI absorb and apply them?
- Or are they somehow inimitable, context-specific?

**Complexity Level**
- Does this passage showcase the author's craft at a level that demonstrates key patterns?
- Or is it either too simple (patterns not evident) or too complex (too many confounds)?

Rate each factor: **HIGH** / **MODERATE** / **LOW**

Provide brief justification for each.

### STEP 5: SUMMARY RECOMMENDATION

**Is this passage suitable as a few-shot example?**

Answer: **YES** / **MAYBE** / **NO**

**Summary Justification (3-5 sentences):**
- Synthesize density rating + task coverage + teaching value
- What would this passage contribute to a few-shot set?
- Or if unsuitable, what disqualifies it?

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Use the Field Guide**: All assessments must reference specific criteria from the guide
2. **Quote Evidence**: Ground every judgment in quoted passages
3. **Distinguish Rating from Quality**: High-quality prose ≠ high-density presence of author's patterns
4. **Be Selective**: Not every passage deserves a 4-5 rating; be discerning
5. **Think Pedagogically**: Consider what an AI would learn from this example
