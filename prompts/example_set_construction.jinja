## TASK: EXAMPLE SET CONSTRUCTION

You are curating a **few-shot example set** from evaluated passages. The set will be used to teach an AI to write in this author's manner through **tacit transmission** - showing, not telling.

Your goal: Select **3-4 passages** that collectively provide the richest implicit instruction.

---

## CURATION PRINCIPLE

The best few-shot set is not simply "the highest-rated passages." It must balance:

1. **Density**: Each passage individually rich with characteristic qualities (ratings 4-5)
2. **Diversity**: Collectively covering different compositional tasks, topics, structures
3. **Complementarity**: Each passage contributing something unique to the set
4. **Coherence**: Together forming a unified demonstration of how this author writes

Think of it as **showing the range within consistency** - different moves, all recognizably theirs.

---

## SELECTION PROCEDURE

### STEP 1: ESTABLISH SELECTION CRITERIA

Based on the field guide and passage evaluations, what should an optimal set include?

Consider:
- **Minimum density**: Only 4-5 rated passages eligible?
- **Task coverage**: Which compositional tasks must be represented?
- **Textural variety**: Different sentence patterns, paragraph lengths, rhetorical modes?
- **Topic diversity**: Different subject matters to prevent content contamination?
- **Length range**: Mix of shorter and longer passages?
- **Teaching priorities**: Which authorial qualities are most crucial to transmit?

List **5-7 selection criteria** you'll use, with brief rationale for each.

### STEP 2: PRIMARY EXAMPLE SET (3-4 passages)

Select your primary set of **3-4 passages**.

For each passage:

```
PASSAGE #[N]: [Evaluation ID or source identifier]

**Density Rating:** [4 or 5]

**What It Demonstrates:**
[Which of the author's characteristic patterns are most visible here?]

**Compositional Task(s):**
[What compositional challenges does this passage exemplify?]

**Unique Contribution:**
[What does this passage add to the set that others don't provide?]

**Brief Excerpt:**
[First 100-150 words to show flavor]
```

After listing all passages, explain **why these specific 3-4** work together as a set.

### STEP 3: SET COHERENCE ASSESSMENT

Assess the set as a whole:

**Well-Represented Aspects**
- Which dimensions of the author's writing are strongly present across the set?
- Sensibility markers?
- Decision patterns?
- Textural features?

**Under-Represented or Missing Aspects**
- What authorial qualities are weakly present or absent?
- Are there compositional tasks the set doesn't demonstrate?
- Textural patterns not shown?

**Learning Prediction**
- If an AI absorbed these 3-4 examples, what would it learn about this author's writing?
- What might it miss or misunderstand?
- Is the set complete enough for tacit transmission?

(Write 2-3 paragraphs)

### STEP 4: ALTERNATIVE/SUPPLEMENTARY PASSAGES

Identify **2-3 additional passages** that could substitute for or supplement the primary set.

For each:

```
ALTERNATIVE: [Evaluation ID or source]

**Rating:** [4 or 5]

**When to Use:**
[Under what circumstances would this passage be preferred?
 - Different compositional focus?
 - Different topic domain?
 - Fills specific gap in primary set?]

**Trade-Off:**
[What does it provide vs. what does the primary set passage provide?]
```

These alternatives allow flexibility for different generation contexts.

### STEP 5: SET VARIANTS (if applicable)

If the corpus and evaluations support it, suggest **variations of the example set** for different purposes:

**For Argumentative Writing:**
[3-4 passage IDs optimized for argumentative tasks]

**For Expository Writing:**
[3-4 passage IDs optimized for explanation and clarification]

**For [Other Mode]:**
[If the author writes in multiple modes evident in the corpus]

For each variant, briefly justify the selection.

(Skip this step if the author's writing doesn't vary enough to merit variants)

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Structure your curation clearly:

```
## EXAMPLE SET CONSTRUCTION

### SELECTION CRITERIA
[List 5-7 criteria with rationales]

### PRIMARY EXAMPLE SET
[3-4 passages with full details]

**Why These Work Together:**
[Explanation of set coherence]

### SET COHERENCE ASSESSMENT
[Analysis of coverage and gaps]

### ALTERNATIVE PASSAGES
[2-3 alternatives with use cases]

### SET VARIANTS [if applicable]
[Different optimized sets for different purposes]
```

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: 3-4 well-chosen passages, not more
2. **Justify Each Selection**: Explain unique contribution to set
3. **Assess Gaps Honestly**: Note what's under-represented
4. **Think Pedagogically**: Consider what an AI would learn
5. **Maintain Diversity**: Avoid redundancy - each passage should add something new
