## TASK: DECISION PATTERN SYNTHESIS

You have **compositional decision analyses** from multiple texts by the same author. Your task is to synthesize these into a **map of the author's characteristic decision-making patterns**.

**CRITICAL: AUTHOR ANONYMITY**
- **Never identify or name the author**, even if their compositional patterns are distinctive and recognizable
- Even if you strongly recognize the author from their characteristic moves or subject matter, **do not name them**
- Treat the author as anonymous throughout your synthesis
- Use only "this author," "the writer," or similar neutral references
- This constraint applies even when cross-text patterns make authorship more evident
- The goal is to create transferable methods for analyzing any author, known or unknown

---

## INPUT

You will receive decision pattern analyses from {{ decision_pattern_analyses|length }} separate texts.

Each analysis identified:
- Specific compositional problems faced
- Choices made to solve them
- Alternatives available
- What each choice achieved

In addition to descriptive text, each analysis quotes text passages from the source texts in support of its claims. They constitute an important reference source for your synthesis.

Your task: Extract **patterns** - the recurring moves, the characteristic solutions, the fingerprints of this author's craft.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: COMPOSITIONAL PROBLEM TAXONOMY

Across all texts, what **types of compositional problems** recur for this author?

Create a taxonomy of major problem categories. These might include:
- Opening a text or major section
- Introducing a complex concept
- Making an abstract idea concrete
- Handling objections or alternative views
- Transitioning between major topics
- Building an argument across paragraphs
- Concluding or consolidating
- Other patterns specific to this author

List **5-8 problem types** with brief descriptions.

### PART 2: CHARACTERISTIC SOLUTIONS

For each problem type identified above, describe this author's **characteristic solution or solutions**.

Format:
```
PROBLEM: [Type]
CHARACTERISTIC APPROACH: [Not "they always do X" but "when facing this problem, they tend to... and variations seem governed by..."]
LOGIC: [What this achieves, what it prioritizes, what it sacrifices]
EXAMPLES: [Cite 2-3 instances across samples with brief quotes]
```

Show the **pattern**, not the rule. Authors aren't mechanical - capture their tendencies and what seems to govern variation.

### PART 3: SIGNATURE MOVES

Identify **"signature moves"** - compositional solutions so characteristic they function almost as fingerprints.

A signature move is:
- Specific enough to recognize
- Frequent enough to be characteristic
- Distinctive enough to distinguish this author from others
- Described in **functional terms** (what it does) not just mechanical terms (how it's formatted)

For each signature move:
```
MOVE: [Memorable label]
SPECIFICATION: [What exactly happens]
WHEN DEPLOYED: [Under what conditions]
WHAT IT ACHIEVES: [Functional purpose]
EXAMPLES: [2-3 instances across samples with quotes]
```

These signature moves will be used in Stage 4 to evaluate whether passages exhibit this author's characteristic decision patterns.

### PART 4: ANTI-PATTERNS

What does this author **characteristically NOT do**?

Identify **3-5 compositional choices** that would be available and perhaps even conventional, but which this author consistently avoids or rarely uses.

For each:
- Describe the avoided pattern
- Speculate briefly on why (based on what you know of their priorities)
- Note if there are rare exceptions and what seems to justify them

Example format:
- **Avoided: Front-loading technical jargon**. This author introduces specialized terms gradually with context, avoiding dense technical openings even when addressing expert audiences. Rare exceptions occur when addressing urgent corrections to specialist discourse.

### PART 5: HIGH-DENSITY PASSAGE INDEX

Compile the **high-density passages** flagged across all individual analyses (passages where multiple decisions converge).

Group them by **which compositional tasks** they most clearly exemplify.

Format:
```
TASK: [e.g., "Introducing complex concepts"]
- [sample_id], [location]: [brief description of what's demonstrated]
- [sample_id], [location]: [brief description]
```

This index will help identify which passages to evaluate in Stage 4.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Patterns, Not Rules**: Capture tendencies and governing conditions, not mechanical formulas
2. **Cite Evidence**: Reference specific samples and quote passages from the source texts
3. **Functional Focus**: Always explain *what the decision achieves*, not just what it is
4. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" throughout
