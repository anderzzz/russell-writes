## TASK: IMPLIED AUTHOR SYNTHESIS

You have **implied author portraits** derived from multiple texts by the same author. Your task is to synthesize these into a **unified portrait** that captures what is stable across texts while acknowledging variation.

This synthesis will form the **sensibility dimension** of the field guide used to evaluate passages for few-shot learning.

---

## INPUT

You will receive implied author analyses from {{ implied_author_analyses|length }} separate texts.

Each analysis constructed a portrait based on:
- Relationship to material
- Relationship to reader
- Relationship to uncertainty
- Relationship to writing itself

Your task: Find what remains constant, note meaningful variation, and synthesize into a unified understanding.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: THE STABLE CORE

What remains **constant across all texts**?

Address each dimension:

**Fundamental Stance Toward Ideas and Inquiry**
- How does this author consistently engage with their subject matter?
- What is their baseline relationship to complexity, discovery, mastery?

**Characteristic Relationship to Readers**
- Who do they consistently write for or to?
- What level of knowledge/sophistication do they assume?
- What is their characteristic tone - collegial, pedagogical, other?

**Handling of Certainty and Uncertainty**
- Where are they consistently confident? Where consistently provisional?
- How do they characteristically signal qualification or assertion?

**Attitude Toward the Prose Itself**
- Is there consistent pleasure in language, or consistent transparency?
- Do they reliably ornament or reliably constrain?

For each element of the stable core, **note which passages across the corpus most vividly exemplify it** (reference sample IDs and brief quotes).

### PART 2: PRODUCTIVE TENSIONS

Where does the author vary? Identify **dimensions of range** within the sensibility - not contradictions, but the spectrum along which they move.

Examples of productive tensions:
- Sometimes more playful, sometimes more severe
- Sometimes more intimate with reader, sometimes more public/formal
- Sometimes discovering, sometimes instructing

For each tension:
- Describe the range
- Note what seems to govern when they move toward one pole vs. another
- Cite examples from different samples

If the author shows no meaningful variation (perfectly consistent), note this - but look carefully first.

### PART 3: THE SYNTHETIC PORTRAIT

Write a **300-400 word** portrait of this implied author that integrates your findings.

Write as you would describe a **mind you have come to know** through multiple encounters:
- Its temperament
- Its values
- Its characteristic ways of engaging with ideas and readers
- Its range and consistency

This portrait should be rich enough that someone reading it could recognize this author in a new, unsigned passage.

**Style**: Descriptive and specific, not generic. Show the sensibility through precise observation.

### PART 4: RECOGNITION MARKERS

Based on your synthesis, list **5-7 telltale signs** of this author's presence.

These should be **specific enough to guide recognition** but not so narrow as to be reductive.

Format each as:
- **[Marker]**: [How it manifests / what to look for]

Example format (adapt to this author):
- **Qualified Authority**: Asserts core claims firmly but immediately acknowledges limits; "X is true, though Y remains unclear"
- **Reader as Equal**: Assumes reader can follow complex reasoning; explains technical terms but not basic logic

These markers will be used in Stage 4 to evaluate whether passages exhibit this author's characteristic sensibility.

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Quote Evidence**: Reference specific samples and passages from the analyses
2. **Specificity**: Avoid generic descriptions - be precise about this particular sensibility
3. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" throughout
4. **Integration**: The portrait should feel unified, not just a list of traits
