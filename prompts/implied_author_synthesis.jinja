## TASK: IMPLIED AUTHOR SYNTHESIS

You have **implied author portraits** derived from multiple texts by the same author. Your task is to synthesize these into a **unified portrait** that captures what is stable across texts while acknowledging variation.

---

## INPUT

You will receive implied author analyses from {{ implied_author_analyses|length }} separate texts.

Each analysis constructed a portrait based on:
- Relationship to material
- Relationship to reader
- Relationship to uncertainty
- Relationship to writing itself

In addition to descriptive text, each analysis quotes text passages from the source texts in support of its claims. They constitute an important reference source for your synthesis.

Your task: Find what remains constant, note meaningful variation, and synthesize into a unified understanding.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: THE STABLE CORE

What remains **constant across all texts**?

Address each dimension:

**Fundamental Stance Toward Ideas and Inquiry**
- How does this author consistently engage with their subject matter?
- What is their baseline relationship to complexity, discovery, mastery?

**Characteristic Relationship to Readers**
- Who do they consistently write for or to?
- What level of knowledge/sophistication do they assume?
- What is their characteristic tone - collegial, pedagogical, other?

**Handling of Certainty and Uncertainty**
- Where are they consistently confident? Where consistently provisional?
- How do they characteristically signal qualification or assertion?

**Attitude Toward the Prose Itself**
- Is there consistent pleasure in language, or consistent transparency?
- Do they reliably ornament or reliably constrain?

Quote relevant text passages from the source texts, as they are quoted in the input analyses.

### PART 2: PRODUCTIVE TENSIONS

Where does the author vary? Identify **dimensions of range** within the sensibility - not contradictions, but the spectrum along which they move.

Examples of productive tensions:
- Sometimes more playful, sometimes more severe
- Sometimes more intimate with reader, sometimes more public/formal
- Sometimes discovering, sometimes instructing

For each tension:
- Describe the range
- Note what seems to govern when they move toward one pole vs. another
- Cite examples from different samples

Quote relevant text passages from the source texts, as they are quoted in the input analyses.

### PART 3: THE SYNTHETIC PORTRAIT

Write a **300-400 word** portrait of this implied author that integrates your findings.

Write as you would describe a **mind you have come to know** through multiple encounters:
- Its temperament
- Its values
- Its characteristic ways of engaging with ideas and readers
- Its range and consistency

This portrait should be rich enough that someone reading it could recognize this author in a new, unsigned passage.

**Style**: Descriptive and specific, not generic. Show the sensibility through precise observation.

### PART 4: RECOGNITION MARKERS

Based on your synthesis, list **5-7 telltale signs** of this author's presence.

These should be **specific enough to guide recognition** but not so narrow as to be reductive.

Format each as:
- **[Marker]**: [How it manifests / what to look for]

Example format (adapt to this author):
- **Qualified Authority**: Asserts core claims firmly but immediately acknowledges limits; "X is true, though Y remains unclear"
- **Reader as Equal**: Assumes reader can follow complex reasoning; explains technical terms but not basic logic

These markers will be used in Stage 4 to evaluate whether passages exhibit this author's characteristic sensibility.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Quote Evidence**: Reference specific quotes from the source texts; these are important scaffolding in order to create a high-quality portrait
2. **Specificity**: Avoid generic descriptions, be precise about this particular sensibility
3. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" throughout; assume the author is unknown to the reader
4. **Integration**: The portrait should feel unified, not just a list of traits, you are ultimately integrating nuggets of understanding derived from multiple distinct source text analyses
