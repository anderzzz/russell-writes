You will evaluate two texts: an ORIGINAL (gold standard) and a RECONSTRUCTION.

Your task: Determine which text better captures the writing style - is the reconstruction stylistically similar to the original, or does the original remain distinctively better?

**Consider these aspects of style:**
- **Rhythm and flow**: How sentences move, their length variation, internal cadences
- **Vocabulary choices**: Level of formality, precision, whether words feel deliberate or natural
- **Structural moves**: How ideas connect, use of transitions, paragraph organization
- **Voice and tone**: The implicit relationship between writer and reader
- **Clarity patterns**: Whether complexity comes from ideas or from prose

**Process:**
1. Read the ORIGINAL carefully and note what makes its prose distinctive
2. Read the RECONSTRUCTION
3. For the reconstruction, identify specific moments where it does/doesn't echo the ORIGINAL's style
4. Make your judgment based on overall stylistic alignment, not content accuracy

**ORIGINAL TEXT:**

{{ original_text }}

---

**RECONSTRUCTION:**

{{ reconstruction_text }}

---

**Your judgment must be returned as JSON with exactly these fields:**

```json
{
  "ranking": "original_better" | "reconstruction_better" | "roughly_equal",
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "reasoning": "Your detailed chain-of-thought explanation here"
}
```

Think step by step about the stylistic features, then provide your structured judgment.
