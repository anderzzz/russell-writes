ANALYTICAL FOCUS: SYNTAX AND SENTENCE MECHANICS

For the provided text, document:
{% set counter = namespace(value=0) %}
{% if include_sentence_structures %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. SENTENCE STRUCTURES
   - Classify each sentence: simple/compound/complex/compound-complex
   - Chart sentence lengths (word count)
   - Note the pattern of variation (or lack thereof)
   - Diagram particularly complex sentences
{% endif %}
{% if include_clause_architecture %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. CLAUSE ARCHITECTURE
   - How are subordinate clauses deployed?
   - Where do main clauses appear (beginning/middle/end)?
   - Identify: relative clauses, participial phrases, appositives
   - How deep does embedding go?
{% endif %}
{% if include_grammatical_features %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. GRAMMATICAL FEATURES
   - Subject positioning (immediate vs. delayed)
   - Voice: active vs. passive (when and why?)
   - Parallelism: where and to what effect?
   - Any unusual or inverted constructions?
{% endif %}
{% if include_functional_observations %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. FUNCTIONAL OBSERVATIONS
   - Does syntax match thought-complexity?
   - Where does sentence structure do semantic work?
   - Are there signature patterns?
{% endif %}
