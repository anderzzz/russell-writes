## TASK: FIELD GUIDE CONSTRUCTION

You are integrating **three synthesized analyses** into a unified **recognition field guide** that will enable evaluation of passages for few-shot learning.

The field guide serves one purpose: **help identify passages where this author's characteristic qualities are most densely present**.

**CRITICAL: AUTHOR ANONYMITY**
- **Never identify or name the author**, even if their characteristics are now very familiar from the syntheses
- Even if you strongly recognize the author from the combined analyses, **do not name them**
- Treat the author as anonymous throughout the field guide
- Use only "this author," "the writer," or similar neutral references
- The field guide must be usable for any author, not just this recognizable one

## INPUT

You have three Stage 2 syntheses:

1. **Implied Author Synthesis**: The sensibility dimension
2. **Decision Pattern Synthesis**: The craft dimension
3. **Textural Synthesis**: The formal dimension

Your task: Integrate these into a **unified guide** with recognition criteria and evaluation rubrics.

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: THE UNIFIED SENSIBILITY (400-500 words)

Write an integrated description of **how this author writes** that synthesizes all three dimensions.

This is not three separate summaries. It's a **unified portrait** showing how:
- Sensibility manifests in decisions
- Decisions are realized in texture
- Texture enacts sensibility

Address:
- What is this author fundamentally *doing* when they write? (Arguing, explaining, discovering, persuading, clarifying?)
- How do the three dimensions work together to achieve this?
- What emerges from the combination that no single perspective captures?
- What is the dominant quality: precision? momentum? accessibility? authority? Something else?

This description should enable someone to **recognize this author's presence** even in unfamiliar passages.

### PART 2: RECOGNITION CRITERIA

Translate the three syntheses into **questions an evaluator can ask** when examining a passage.

Organize by dimension:

**A. SENSIBILITY MARKERS**
Questions that probe whether the implied author's characteristic stance is present:
- [5-7 specific questions]
- Example: "Does the prose position the reader as an equal capable of following complex reasoning?"

**B. DECISION MARKERS**
Questions that probe whether characteristic compositional choices are being made:
- [5-7 specific questions]
- Example: "When introducing complex concepts, does the author provide concrete anchors before abstraction?"

**C. TEXTURAL MARKERS**
Questions that probe whether the characteristic prose texture is present:
- [5-7 specific questions]
- Example: "Do sentences place core claims in independent clauses with qualifications in subordinate positions?"

**D. INTEGRATION MARKERS**
Questions that probe whether sensibility, decisions, and texture are working together:
- [3-5 specific questions]
- Example: "Does the sentence structure enact the mode of thinking being described?"

These questions will guide passage evaluation in Stage 4.

### PART 3: DENSITY EVALUATION RUBRIC

Construct a rubric for rating passages **1-5** based on density of characteristic qualities.

For each level, describe what **presence or absence** of which qualities would place a passage there:

**RATING 5: PARADIGMATIC**
This passage could teach someone to recognize this author. Sensibility, decisions, and texture all present and integrated. [Specify what "all present and integrated" means for this author]

**RATING 4: STRONGLY CHARACTERISTIC**
Most signature elements present, integration strong. [Specify what elements must be present]

**RATING 3: RECOGNIZABLY THIS AUTHOR**
Enough markers to identify authorship, but some elements muted or missing. [Specify threshold]

**RATING 2: WEAKLY CHARACTERISTIC**
Occasional markers visible, but much could have been written by others. [Specify what's missing]

**RATING 1: NOT USEFUL AS EXAMPLE**
Author's distinctive qualities largely absent. May be atypical for this author or lack density. [Specify disqualifiers]

The rubric should be **specific to this author** - not generic quality ratings, but presence/absence of *their* characteristic features.

### PART 4: MASTER PASSAGE INDEX

Compile **all passages flagged** across the Stage 1 and Stage 2 analyses:
- Signature moments (from implied author analyses)
- High-density decision passages (from decision analyses)
- Texturally distinctive passages (from texture analyses)
- Exemplary passages (from syntheses)

For each passage:
```
SAMPLE: [sample_id]
LOCATION: [paragraph range if specified]
SOURCE: [Which analysis flagged it: implied_author, decision_pattern, textural, or synthesis]
WHY FLAGGED: [Brief note on what it exemplifies]
```

Remove duplicates (same passage flagged by multiple analyses - note which ones).

This index provides **seed candidates** for Stage 4 evaluation.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Integration**: Part 1 must feel unified, not compartmentalized
2. **Specificity**: Recognition criteria and rubric must be tailored to this author
3. **Actionable**: Questions should be answerable; rubric levels should be distinguishable
4. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" throughout
5. **Provenance**: Master index must reference source analyses
