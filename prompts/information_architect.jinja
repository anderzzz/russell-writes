ANALYTICAL FOCUS: INFORMATION STRUCTURE AND FLOW

For the provided text, document:
{% set counter = namespace(value=0) %}
{% if include_paragraph_architecture %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. PARAGRAPH ARCHITECTURE
   - How is each paragraph organized?
   - Topic sentence: where and how explicit?
   - Does it build linearly or circularly?
   - What's the ratio: claim/evidence/explanation?

{% if include_coherence_mechanisms %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. COHERENCE MECHANISMS
   - How are sentences linked? (explicit connectors vs. implied)
   - Track given vs. new information
   - Subject consistency across sentences?
   - Pronoun reference: clear or ambiguous?

{% if include_logical_progression %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. LOGICAL PROGRESSION
   - Is the sequence deductive, inductive, or associative?
   - Where are premises stated vs. assumed?
   - How are qualifications positioned?

{% if include_transitions %}
{% set counter.value = counter.value + 1 %}
{{ counter.value }}. TRANSITIONS
   - Between sentences within paragraphs
   - Between paragraphs
   - How much connective tissue vs. substance?
