## TASK: FUNCTIONAL TEXTURE ANALYSIS

You are analyzing a text to understand how its **surface features** - sentence structure, word choice, rhythm, paragraph shape - serve its communicative purposes.

The goal is **not** to catalog features but to understand **why the prose feels and functions as it does**.

---

## ANALYTICAL PRINCIPLE

Texture is not decoration. It enacts meaning.

The way a sentence unfolds, the words chosen, the rhythm created - these are not separate from what the text says. They are **how the content achieves its effect**.

Your task: Show how form serves function.

## ANALYTICAL DIMENSIONS

### 1. SENTENCE-LEVEL PATTERNS

**Characteristic Shape**
- What is the typical sentence structure? (Not average length, but the *feel* of how sentences are built)
- How does the author manage complexity? Front-loaded, back-loaded, distributed?
- What is the relationship between main clauses and subordination?

**Deviations and Triggers**
- Where do sentences deviate from the dominant pattern?
- What seems to trigger longer sentences? Shorter ones?
- How does variation create emphasis or rhythm?

**Form-Meaning Integration**
Find **2-3 examples** where the **shape of the sentence reinforces or embodies what it says**.

Example: A sentence describing gradual accumulation that itself accumulates clauses; a sentence about abrupt change that pivots sharply mid-structure.

### 2. LEXICAL PATTERNS

**Dominant Register**
- Is the vocabulary technical, colloquial, formal, or mixed?
- How does the author handle the boundary between precision and accessibility?

**Characteristic Choices**
- Are there preferences in verb types (active/passive, dynamic/stative)?
- Concrete versus abstract nouns - what's the balance?
- Recurring qualifiers or intensifiers?

**Precision-Accessibility Balance**
- Where does specialized vocabulary appear?
- How is it introduced - defined, contextualized, or assumed?

### 3. RHYTHMIC PATTERNS

**Read a paragraph aloud** (or imagine doing so).

- What is its rhythm? Flowing, staccato, varied?
- Where does the prose speed up or slow down? What creates these effects?
- Is there a relationship between rhythm and emphasis? Do important ideas occupy rhythmically distinctive positions?

### 4. PARAGRAPH-LEVEL PATTERNS

**Opening Moves**
- How do paragraphs typically begin? Is there a characteristic opening move?

**Internal Structure**
- What is the characteristic development pattern?
- Examples: Claim → elaboration? Question → answer? Thesis → antithesis?

**Closing Moves**
- How do paragraphs end? Do they close, pivot, or trail off?

**Sequential Relationships**
- How do paragraphs relate to each other?
- How does the author construct multi-paragraph sequences?

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### PART 1: SENTENCE ARCHITECTURE

Describe the characteristic sentence, addressing:
- Typical structure and complexity management
- Deviation patterns
- 2-3 examples where sentence shape embodies meaning

### PART 2: LEXICAL CHARACTER

Describe characteristic word choice, addressing:
- Register and precision-accessibility balance
- Verb, noun, and modifier preferences
- How specialized vocabulary is handled

### PART 3: RHYTHMIC QUALITY

Describe the prose rhythm, addressing:
- Overall rhythmic character
- What creates speed/slowness
- Relationship between rhythm and emphasis

### PART 4: PARAGRAPH SHAPE

Describe characteristic paragraph structure, addressing:
- Opening and closing moves
- Internal development patterns
- How paragraphs sequence together

### PART 5: FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION

**This is the synthesis:**

How do these textural features work together to serve the author's purposes?

Select **one paragraph** that you find particularly effective. Analyze how sentence structure, word choice, and rhythm combine to produce its effect. **Show the machinery.**

### PART 6: TEXTURALLY DISTINCTIVE PASSAGES

Flag **2-3 passages** where this author's way of building sentences and paragraphs is most recognizably theirs.

For each:
- Quote the passage
- Explain what makes it texturally distinctive
- Note which features converge here

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **Function Over Form**: Always explain *what the feature achieves*, not just that it exists
2. **Quote Evidence**: Ground observations in specific passages
3. **Avoid Generic Terms**: Not "clear" or "flowing" - describe *how* and *why*
4. **Author-Agnostic**: Refer to "this author" or "the writer"
