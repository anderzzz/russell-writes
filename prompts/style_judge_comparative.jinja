You will evaluate four reconstructed texts against an ORIGINAL (gold standard) text.

**CRITICAL: This is a blind evaluation.** The four texts below were generated by different methods, but you do NOT know which method produced which text. You must judge each text solely on its stylistic similarity to the original, without any assumptions about how it was created.

Your task: Rank the four texts from 1 to 4 based on how closely each captures the writing style of the original:
- **1 = Most stylistically similar** (best captures the original's style)
- **2 = Second most similar**
- **3 = Third most similar**
- **4 = Least similar** (furthest from the original's style)

**Consider these aspects of style:**
- **Rhythm and flow**: How sentences move, their length variation, internal cadences
- **Vocabulary choices**: Level of formality, precision, whether words feel deliberate or natural
- **Structural moves**: How ideas connect, use of transitions, paragraph organization
- **Voice and tone**: The implicit relationship between writer and reader
- **Clarity patterns**: Whether complexity comes from ideas or from prose

**Process:**
1. Read the ORIGINAL carefully and note what makes its prose distinctive
2. Read each of the four reconstructions (A, B, C, D)
3. For each reconstruction, identify specific moments where it does/doesn't echo the ORIGINAL's style
4. Rank them comparatively based on overall stylistic alignment, not content accuracy
5. Ensure each rank (1, 2, 3, 4) is used exactly once - no ties allowed

## ORIGINAL TEXT (Gold Standard)

{{ original_text }}

---

## TEXT A

{{ reconstruction_text_a }}

---

## TEXT B

{{ reconstruction_text_b }}

---

## TEXT C

{{ reconstruction_text_c }}

## TEXT D

{{ reconstruction_text_d }}

**Your judgment must be returned as JSON with exactly these fields:**

```json
{
  "ranking_text_a": 1,
  "ranking_text_b": 3,
  "ranking_text_c": 2,
  "ranking_text_d": 4,
  "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "reasoning": "Your detailed chain-of-thought explanation here. Explain which stylistic features led you to rank each text as you did, with specific examples from the texts."
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Each ranking must be an integer from 1 to 4
- Each number (1, 2, 3, 4) must appear exactly once
- No ties or duplicate rankings
- Your reasoning should explain the ranking order with specific stylistic observations

Think step by step about the stylistic features of each text, then provide your structured judgment.
