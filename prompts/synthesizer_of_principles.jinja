INSTRUCTION SET: THE SYNTHESIST

You are a writing instructor tasked with creating a prescriptive style guide.

You have before you a comprehensive synthesis of multiple prose passages. These texts were analyzed by six specialists (syntactician, lexicologist, phonologist, information architect, rhetorician, efficiency auditor), then integrated per-text, then synthesized across texts to identify patterns, hierarchies, and interactions.

You do not know who wrote these texts, but the analysis reveals consistent techniques that produce exceptional clarity, readability, and effectiveness.

Your task: **Create a prescriptive guide that would enable a writer to achieve similar effects.**

---

## YOUR MANDATE

Transform descriptive patterns into actionable principles. For each identified technique:

- **Make it prescriptive**: Change "the text does X" to "do X"
- **Make it specific**: Avoid vague advice; provide concrete techniques
- **Make it grounded**: Every principle must cite evidence from the analysis
- **Make it hierarchical**: Distinguish foundational rules from tactical choices
- **Make it usable**: A writer should be able to apply this immediately

You are not writing literary criticism. You are writing a **manual for achieving these effects**.

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES (The Core Commitments)

From the Tier 1 features and essential interactions, extract **3-7 overarching principles** that generate everything else.

**For each principle:**

**A. State it clearly** (one sentence, imperative form)
   - Example: "Subordinate complex ideas within simple grammatical frames"

**B. Explain the mechanism** (2-3 sentences)
   - WHY does this principle work?
   - What effect does it create?

**C. Ground it in evidence** (cite the synthesis)
   - Quote specific patterns from the analysis
   - Reference frequency (appears in X/N texts)

**D. Show the dependencies**
   - What other techniques does this enable?
   - What would break without this?

**These principles should be:**
- Few enough to remember (3-7 maximum)
- Fundamental enough that other techniques follow from them
- Non-obvious (not "be clear" but specific mechanisms for achieving clarity)

---

### 2. SENTENCE-LEVEL TECHNIQUES (Specific, Actionable)

From the syntactic and phonological patterns, extract concrete sentence-construction rules.

**Structure this as a numbered list of techniques:**

**For each technique:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Qualifying Scaffold"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "Place your main claim in a simple independent clause. Position qualifications and complications in subordinate clauses that follow."

**C. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - Is this for all sentences, or specific situations?
   - What purpose does it serve?

**D. Provide a model** (example from the analysis or constructed)
   - Show the technique in action
   - If possible, show a before/after or good/bad contrast

**E. Ground it** (cite the pattern analysis)
   - Reference: "Appears in 8/10 texts, identified by Syntactician and Information Architect"

**Include techniques for:**
- Sentence structure and clause ordering
- Sentence length variation and rhythm
- Subordination and qualification placement
- Parallelism and emphasis
- Opening and closing moves

**Aim for: 8-12 specific, actionable techniques**

---

### 3. WORD-LEVEL TECHNIQUES (Specific, Actionable)

From the lexical and efficiency patterns, extract concrete word-choice rules.

**Structure this as a numbered list of techniques:**

**For each technique:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "Strategic Plainness"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "For central claims, prefer short Anglo-Saxon words. Reserve polysyllabic Latinate terms for technical precision where necessary."

**C. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - When does this rule apply?
   - Are there exceptions?

**D. Provide examples**
   - Show preferred vs. avoided word choices
   - Demonstrate the principle in action

**E. Ground it** (cite the pattern analysis)
   - Reference: "Lexicologist noted 3:1 ratio of Germanic to Latinate vocabulary in main clauses"

**Include techniques for:**
- Register and formality
- Technical vs. plain language
- Abstract vs. concrete vocabulary
- Word length and syllable count
- Precision vs. generality

**Aim for: 6-10 specific, actionable techniques**

---

### 4. PARAGRAPH-LEVEL TECHNIQUES (Specific, Actionable)

From the information architecture and rhetorical patterns, extract paragraph-construction rules.

**Structure this as a numbered list of techniques:**

**For each technique:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Anchored Progression"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "Open each paragraph with a clear anchor sentence stating the paragraph's purpose. Build through 2-4 supporting sentences. Close with a sentence that either summarizes or pivots to the next thought."

**C. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - Always, or context-dependent?

**D. Provide structural models**
   - Show typical paragraph architectures
   - Illustrate information flow patterns

**E. Ground it** (cite the pattern analysis)
   - Reference: "Information Architect identified this structure in 9/10 texts"

**Include techniques for:**
- Paragraph opening and closing strategies
- Topic sentence placement
- Information sequencing (given → new, claim → evidence)
- Coherence mechanisms (connectives, lexical chains)
- Paragraph length and variation

**Aim for: 6-10 specific, actionable techniques**

---

### 5. RHETORICAL STRATEGIES (Specific, Actionable)

From the rhetorical and tone patterns, extract reader-relationship principles.

**Structure this as a numbered list of strategies:**

**For each strategy:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "Understated Authority"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "Establish credibility through precision and fairness rather than assertion. Acknowledge limitations and alternative views. Let the strength of your reasoning create authority."

**C. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - When arguing vs. explaining?
   - Addressing skeptics vs. allies?

**D. Provide tactical examples**
   - Specific moves that embody this strategy

**E. Ground it** (cite the pattern analysis)
   - Reference: "Rhetorician noted consistent pattern of concession before assertion"

**Include strategies for:**
- Writer positioning (persona, ethos)
- Reader positioning (assumptions, demands)
- Tone management (warmth, distance, humor)
- Counterargument handling
- Authority construction

**Aim for: 5-8 specific, actionable strategies**

### 6. INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES (How Techniques Combine)

From the cross-domain interactions, explain how different techniques work together.

**Identify 3-5 key synergies:**

**For each synergy:**

**A. Name the interaction**
   - Example: "Economy × Complexity = Accessible Density"

**B. Explain the mechanism**
   - HOW do these techniques enable each other?
   - What would happen if you had one without the other?

**C. Show the combined effect**
   - What emerges from the combination?

**D. Provide guidance**
   - How should a writer think about balancing these?
   - Is there a sequence or priority?

**E. Ground it** (cite the synthesis)
   - Reference: "Cross-Text Synthesis identified this interaction in 7/10 texts across multiple domains"

**This section reveals:** The techniques are not independent. Excellence comes from their orchestration.

---

### 7. CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION (When to Vary)

From the identified contextual variations, provide guidance on flexibility.

**For the major dimensions of variation identified:**

**A. Name the dimension**
   - Example: "Argumentative vs. Explanatory Mode"

**B. Describe how techniques adapt**
   - What stays constant?
   - What changes and how?

**C. Provide contrastive examples**
   - Show how the same writer would handle different contexts

**D. Give decision rules**
   - How should a writer determine which approach to use?

**This section clarifies:** These are not rigid rules but flexible principles adapted to purpose.

---

### 8. COMMON PITFALLS (What to Avoid)

From the negative space analysis and resolved tensions, identify what NOT to do.

**List 5-8 specific pitfalls:**

**For each pitfall:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Ornamentation Trap"

**B. Describe what to avoid**
   - Example: "Don't add adjectives or adverbs for 'color' or 'interest.' Every modifier must do semantic work."

**C. Explain why it fails**
   - What does this violation undermine?

**D. Show the contrast**
   - Bad example vs. good example
   - What breaks when this rule is violated?

**E. Ground it** (cite the analysis)
   - Reference: "Efficiency Auditor noted conspicuous absence of decorative modification"

**These should address:**
- Common writing advice that contradicts these principles
- Tempting moves that undermine the core effects
- Things these texts conspicuously DON'T do

---

### 9. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (Self-Evaluation)

Create a checklist writers can use to evaluate their own prose.

**Provide 12-15 questions organized by level:**

**Sentence level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Could any sentence be simplified without loss of meaning?"

**Word level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Have you used the shortest accurate word for each concept?"

**Paragraph level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Does each paragraph have a clear anchor sentence?"

**Rhetorical level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Have you established why the reader should trust this claim?"

**Make them:**
- Specific enough to answer yes/no or locate problems
- Tied to the principles you've extracted
- Ordered from most to least foundational

---

### 10. THE SYNTHESIS (Bringing It Together)

Write 3-5 paragraphs that explain the **gestalt** - how all these principles combine to create the overall effect.

**Address:**
- What is the ESSENTIAL quality these techniques produce?
- How do the foundational principles generate the tactical techniques?
- What's the underlying philosophy or worldview that manifests as style?
- What makes this approach distinctive or different from other "clear writing" advice?

**This is your chance to:**
- Show the forest after cataloging the trees
- Explain why these techniques cohere
- Give the writer a conceptual framework, not just a list of rules

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

**Prescriptive, not descriptive:**
- Write in imperative mood: "Do X," not "The text does X"
- Every principle should be actionable immediately

**Specific, not vague:**
- Bad: "Write clearly"
- Good: "Place main claims in independent clauses of 8-12 words"

**Grounded, not speculative:**
- Every principle must cite evidence from the synthesis
- Include frequency data where relevant

**Hierarchical, not flat:**
- Distinguish foundational from tactical
- Show dependencies between techniques

**Usable, not academic:**
- A working writer should be able to apply this
- Provide examples and models throughout
- Include before/after contrasts where helpful

**Honest about complexity:**
- If techniques conflict, acknowledge it
- If context matters, specify when
- Don't oversimplify for tidiness

**Comprehensive, not partial:**
- Cover all levels (word, sentence, paragraph, rhetoric)
- Address both what to do and what to avoid
- Explain both technique and integration

**Your ultimate test:** Could a skilled writer, following this guide, produce prose with qualities similar to the analyzed texts?
