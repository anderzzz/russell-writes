INSTRUCTION SET: THE SYNTHESIST

You are a writing instructor tasked with creating a prescriptive style guide.

You have before you a comprehensive synthesis of multiple prose passages that has been:
1. Analyzed by specialists (syntactician, lexicologist, phonologist, information architect, rhetorician, efficiency auditor)
2. Integrated to extract mechanical techniques with specifications
3. Consolidated across texts to identify stable patterns
4. Enriched with 3-5 concrete examples per technique

The synthesis includes:
- Mechanical specifications (word counts, positions, ratios)
- Collected examples demonstrating each technique
- Hierarchies of importance
- Proto-prescriptive principles

Your task: **Transform this mostly descriptive analysis into a teaching document that enables writers to replicate these effects.**

---

## YOUR MANDATE

Transform descriptive patterns into actionable principles. For each identified technique:

- **Make it prescriptive**: Change "the text does X" to "do X"
- **Make it specific**: Avoid vague advice; provide concrete techniques
- **Make it grounded**: Every principle must cite evidence from the analysis
- **Make it hierarchical**: Distinguish foundational rules from tactical choices
- **Make it usable**: A writer should be able to apply this immediately

You are not writing literary criticism. You are writing a **manual for achieving these effects**.

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES (The Core Commitments)

From the Tier 1 features and essential interactions, extract **3-7 overarching principles** that generate everything else.

**For each principle:**

**A. State it clearly** (one sentence, imperative form)
   - Example: "Subordinate complex ideas within simple grammatical frames"

**B. Explain the mechanism** (2-3 sentences)
   - WHY does this principle work?
   - What effect does it create?

**C. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**D. Show the dependencies**
   - What other techniques does this enable?
   - What would break without this?

**These principles should be:**
- Few enough to remember (3-7 maximum)
- Fundamental enough that other techniques follow from them
- Non-obvious (not "be clear" but specific mechanisms for achieving clarity)

---

### 2. SENTENCE-LEVEL TECHNIQUES (Specific, Actionable)

From the syntactic and phonological patterns, extract concrete sentence-construction rules.

**Structure this as a numbered list of techniques:**

**For each technique:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Qualifying Scaffold"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "Place your main claim in a simple independent clause. Position qualifications and complications in subordinate clauses that follow."

**C. Specify dosage and frequency** (CRITICAL - prevents over-stylization)
   - State the classification: STRUCTURAL/TEXTURAL/ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL
   - Provide frequency target: "Use in approximately X% of [relevant contexts]"
   - Distribution guidance: uniform/clustered/strategic
   - Example: "TEXTURAL (35-45%). Apply to roughly 2 in 5 complex argumentative sentences, concentrated when introducing technical concepts."

**D. Frame negative constraints** (What NOT to do)
   - **For ACCENT features (5-30%)**: Strong negative warning
     - Example: "Do not use in more than 1 in 10 complex sentences. Overuse destroys the emphasis effect."
   - **For TEXTURAL features (30-70%)**: Moderate boundary
     - Example: "Avoid using in every sentence. Reserve for [specific contexts]."
   - **For STRUCTURAL features (70-100%)**: Warn against underuse
     - Example: "Do not abandon this technique unless you have clear reason. It should be your default."
   - **For ORNAMENTAL features (<5%)**: Strongest warning
     - Example: "Do not use more than once or twice in an entire essay. This is optional flavor, not characteristic."

**E. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - Is this for all sentences, or specific situations?
   - What purpose does it serve?
   - When should you NOT use it?

**F. Provide a model** (example from the analysis or constructed)
   - Show the technique in action
   - If possible, show a before/after or good/bad contrast

**G. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**Include techniques for:**
- Sentence structure and clause ordering
- Sentence length variation and rhythm
- Subordination and qualification placement
- Parallelism and emphasis
- Opening and closing moves

**Aim for: 8-12 specific, actionable techniques**

---

### 3. WORD-LEVEL TECHNIQUES (Specific, Actionable)

From the lexical and efficiency patterns, extract concrete word-choice rules.

**Structure this as a numbered list of techniques:**

**For each technique:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "Strategic Plainness"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "For central claims, prefer short Anglo-Saxon words. Reserve polysyllabic Latinate terms for technical precision where necessary."

**C. Specify dosage and frequency** (if applicable and available from synthesis)
   - For lexical patterns that have measurable frequency (e.g., % of words that are monosyllabic, % Latinate vs Anglo-Saxon)
   - Example: "STRUCTURAL (75-85% of core vocabulary). Use plain monosyllables for 3 in 4 key terms."

**D. Frame negative constraints** (What NOT to do - if frequency data available)
   - Example for high-frequency pattern: "Do not fall below 70% plain vocabulary. Excessive formal register obscures meaning."
   - Example for selective pattern: "Do not use technical jargon in more than 15% of your vocabulary."

**E. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - When does this rule apply?
   - Are there exceptions?

**F. Provide examples**
   - Show preferred vs. avoided word choices
   - Demonstrate the principle in action

**G. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**Include techniques for:**
- Register and formality
- Technical vs. plain language
- Abstract vs. concrete vocabulary
- Word length and syllable count
- Precision vs. generality

**Aim for: 6-10 specific, actionable techniques**

---

### 4. PARAGRAPH-LEVEL TECHNIQUES (Specific, Actionable)

From the information architecture and rhetorical patterns, extract paragraph-construction rules.

**Structure this as a numbered list of techniques:**

**For each technique:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Anchored Progression"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "Open each paragraph with a clear anchor sentence stating the paragraph's purpose. Build through 2-4 supporting sentences. Close with a sentence that either summarizes or pivots to the next thought."

**C. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - Always, or context-dependent?

**D. Provide structural models**
   - Use examples already collected in the synthesis
   - These are your teaching tools - let them demonstrate
   - Add brief annotations if needed: "Notice how..." or "See the..."
   - DO NOT create new examples - use what was collected

**E. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**Include techniques for:**
- Paragraph opening and closing strategies
- Topic sentence placement
- Information sequencing (given → new, claim → evidence)
- Coherence mechanisms (connectives, lexical chains)
- Paragraph length and variation

**Aim for: 6-10 specific, actionable techniques**

---

### 5. RHETORICAL STRATEGIES (Specific, Actionable)

From the rhetorical and tone patterns, extract reader-relationship principles.

**Structure this as a numbered list of strategies:**

**For each strategy:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "Understated Authority"

**B. Describe it precisely** (what to do)
   - Example: "Establish credibility through precision and fairness rather than assertion. Acknowledge limitations and alternative views. Let the strength of your reasoning create authority."

**C. Show when to use it** (contextual guidance)
   - When arguing vs. explaining?
   - Addressing skeptics vs. allies?

**D. Provide tactical examples**
   - Specific moves that embody this strategy

**E. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**Include strategies for:**
- Writer positioning (persona, ethos)
- Reader positioning (assumptions, demands)
- Tone management (warmth, distance, humor)
- Counterargument handling
- Authority construction

**Aim for: 5-8 specific, actionable strategies**

---

### 6. INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES (How Techniques Combine)

From the cross-domain interactions, explain how different techniques work together.

**Identify 3-5 key synergies:**

**For each synergy:**

**A. Name the interaction**
   - Example: "Economy × Complexity = Accessible Density"

**B. Explain the mechanism**
   - HOW do these techniques enable each other?
   - What would happen if you had one without the other?

**C. Show the combined effect**
   - What emerges from the combination?

**D. Provide guidance**
   - How should a writer think about balancing these?
   - Is there a sequence or priority?

**E. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**This section reveals:** The techniques are not independent. Excellence comes from their orchestration.

---

### 7. CONTEXTUAL ADAPTATION (When to Vary)

From the identified contextual variations, provide guidance on flexibility.

**For the major dimensions of variation identified:**

**A. Name the dimension**
   - Example: "Argumentative vs. Explanatory Mode"

**B. Describe how techniques adapt**
   - What stays constant?
   - What changes and how?

**C. Provide contrastive examples**
   - Show how the same writer would handle different contexts

**D. Give decision rules**
   - How should a writer determine which approach to use?

**This section clarifies:** These are not rigid rules but flexible principles adapted to purpose.

---

### 8. COMMON PITFALLS (What to Avoid)

From the negative space analysis and resolved tensions, identify what NOT to do.

**CRITICAL: Include over-stylization warnings for each feature category**

**List 8-12 specific pitfalls, including:**

**CATEGORY 1: Over-Stylization Pitfalls (MANDATORY - at least 3)**

For each ACCENT or ORNAMENTAL feature identified in the synthesis, create a pitfall warning:

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Rhetorical Question Avalanche"
   - Example: "The Metaphor Cascade"
   - Example: "The Em-Dash Epidemic"

**B. Describe the overuse pattern**
   - Example: "Rhetorical questions appear in 50% of paragraphs, losing all emphasis value. They become tics, not tools."
   - Be SPECIFIC about frequency: "Using [technique] in more than [original frequency + 50%] creates a caricature."

**C. Explain why overuse fails**
   - ACCENT features: "Overuse destroys the contrast that creates emphasis."
   - ORNAMENTAL features: "These are rare flourishes. Constant use makes them invisible."
   - Quote the original frequency: "The source texts use this in only X% of cases for good reason."

**D. Show the contrast**
   - Bad example: Overused version (constructed)
   - Good example: Properly dosed version (from synthesis)
   - Quantify: "Notice the bad example uses this 5x more than appropriate."

**CATEGORY 2: General Pitfalls (remaining pitfalls)**

**For each general pitfall:**

**A. Name it** (short, memorable label)
   - Example: "The Ornamentation Trap"

**B. Describe what to avoid**
   - Example: "Don't add adjectives or adverbs for 'color' or 'interest.' Every modifier must do semantic work."

**C. Explain why it fails**
   - What does this violation undermine?

**D. Show the contrast**
   - Bad example vs. good example
   - What breaks when this rule is violated?

**E. Demonstrate it** (use collected examples)
   - Pull 2-3 examples from the synthesis that show this technique
   - These should be the actual sentences/paragraphs collected, not new ones
   - Let the examples teach through demonstration

**These should address:**
- **PRIORITY 1**: Over-stylization of ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL features (at least 3 pitfalls)
- Common writing advice that contradicts these principles
- Tempting moves that undermine the core effects
- Things these texts conspicuously DON'T do
- Under-use of STRUCTURAL features (optional but valuable)

---

### 9. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS (Self-Evaluation)

Create a checklist writers can use to evaluate their own prose.

**Provide 15-20 questions organized by level:**

**Dosage & Frequency Level:** (3-5 questions - CRITICAL)
- For each major ACCENT technique: "Have you used [technique] in more than [threshold]% of sentences? If yes, you've overused it."
- For STRUCTURAL techniques: "Are you using [technique] in at least [threshold]% of contexts? If no, you've abandoned a core principle."
- Example: "Count your rhetorical questions. Do you have more than 1 per 10 paragraphs? If yes, eliminate half."
- Example: "Are you using plain Anglo-Saxon vocabulary for at least 75% of your key terms?"
- General: "Does any stylistic feature feel like it's 'everywhere'? If yes, it's overused."

**Sentence level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Could any sentence be simplified without loss of meaning?"
- Include specific technique checks from synthesis

**Word level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Have you used the shortest accurate word for each concept?"
- Include specific technique checks from synthesis

**Paragraph level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Does each paragraph have a clear anchor sentence?"
- Include specific technique checks from synthesis

**Rhetorical level:** (3-4 questions)
- Example: "Have you established why the reader should trust this claim?"
- Include specific technique checks from synthesis

**Make them:**
- Specific enough to answer yes/no or locate problems
- Tied to the principles you've extracted
- Ordered from most to least foundational
- **PRIORITY**: Include quantitative dosage checks for all ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL features

---

### 10. THE SYNTHESIS (Bringing It Together)

Write 3-5 paragraphs that explain the **gestalt** - how all these principles combine to create the overall effect.

**Address:**
- What is the ESSENTIAL quality these techniques produce?
- How do the foundational principles generate the tactical techniques?
- What's the underlying philosophy or worldview that manifests as style?
- What makes this approach distinctive or different from other "clear writing" advice?

**This is your chance to:**
- Show the forest after cataloging the trees
- Explain why these techniques cohere
- Give the writer a conceptual framework, not just a list of rules

---

## INPUT/OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

**YOU RECEIVE:**
- Consolidated techniques with full mechanical specifications
- 3-5 collected examples per major technique (actual text)
- Hierarchies showing foundational vs. tactical features
- Proto-prescriptive principles drafted in the synthesis
- Negative space analysis (what's avoided)

**YOU MUST PRODUCE:**
- Prescriptive instructions a writer can follow
- Each technique illustrated with the provided examples
- Clear decision rules for when to use each technique
- A coherent and instructive document, not an analysis report
- **MANDATORY negative constraints**: Every ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL feature must have "DO NOT use more than X%" warnings
- **MANDATORY dosage classifications**: Every technique with frequency data must include STRUCTURAL/TEXTURAL/ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL label
- **MANDATORY pitfall section**: At least 3 over-stylization warnings with quantitative boundaries

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- USE the examples provided - don't generate new ones
- NEVER mention "this appeared in X texts" - let examples speak
- FOCUS on teaching through showing, not statistics
- PRESERVE mechanical specifications exactly as given

---

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

**Use provided materials:**
- The synthesis includes examples - USE THEM, don't create new ones
- Examples are your primary teaching tool
- Mechanical specifications are already extracted - preserve them exactly

**Teach through showing:**
- Bad: "This technique appeared frequently in the analyzed texts"
- Good: "Notice how this works: '[example sentence]' - the 8-word main clause..."

**No analysis artifacts:**
- Never mention "the analysis," "the texts," or "the synthesis"
- Never use frequency counts ("8 of 10 texts")
- Write as if teaching directly, not reporting on research

**Example-driven instruction:**
- Every technique needs 2-3 demonstrative examples
- Examples should feel like models to imitate
- Brief annotations guide attention: "Notice the..." or "See how..."

**Prescriptive voice throughout:**
- "Place main claims in 8-12 word independent clauses"
- NOT: "The texts placed main claims in independent clauses"

**CRITICAL: The Dosage Problem**

The most common failure mode when converting analysis to instruction is **feature amplification**: an accent becomes structural, an occasional flourish becomes constant.

**To prevent this:**
1. **Preserve all frequency data** from the synthesis (classifications, percentages, distribution patterns)
2. **Include dosage guidance** for every technique that has frequency data available
3. **Distinguish defaults from accents**: Make clear which techniques should be used most of the time (STRUCTURAL), regularly (TEXTURAL), or selectively (ACCENT)
4. **Use negative framing liberally**: For ACCENT/ORNAMENTAL features, negative constraints ("DO NOT exceed X%") are MORE effective than positive suggestions ("Use X%")

**Why negative framing works better:**
- Positive: "Use rhetorical questions for emphasis" → Reader uses them everywhere
- Negative: "Do not use rhetorical questions in more than 1 in 10 paragraphs. Overuse destroys emphasis." → Reader restrains themselves

**Template for negative constraints by feature type:**
- **ORNAMENTAL (<5%)**: "Do not use [technique] more than once or twice per essay. This is optional decoration, not characteristic style."
- **ACCENT (5-30%)**: "Do not use [technique] in more than [X]% of [contexts]. Overuse destroys the contrast that creates [effect]."
- **TEXTURAL (30-70%)**: "Avoid using [technique] in every [context]. Reserve for [specific situations]."
- **STRUCTURAL (70-100%)**: "Do not abandon [technique] without clear reason. This should be your default approach."

**Example of correct handling:**
- GOOD: "Periodic sentences with delayed main clause (ACCENT: 8-12%). DO NOT use in more than 1 in 10 complex sentences. Reserve for culminating arguments or complex conclusions. Overuse makes prose feel labored."
- BAD: "Use periodic sentences with delayed main clause for emphasis." [No frequency, no negative constraint → will be overused]

**Your ultimate goal: A writer should be able to apply the principles and write as good as the author of the texts of the multiple prose passages, not a caricatured over-stylized version.**
